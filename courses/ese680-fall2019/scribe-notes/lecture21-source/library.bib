abstract = {Direct policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning and continuous control problems arc a popular approach for a variety of reasons: 1) they are easy to implement without explicit knowledge of the underlying model, 2) they are an "end- to-end" approach, directly optimizing the performance metric of interest, 3) they inherently allow for richly parameterized policies. A notable drawback is that even in the most basic continuous control problem (that of linear quadratic regulators), these methods must solve a non-convex optimization problem, where little is understood about their efficiency from both computational and statistical perspectives. In contrast, system identification and model based planning in opti- : Mal control theory have a much more solid theo- ! retical footing, where much is known with regards to their computational and statistical properties. , This work bridges this gap showing that (model ; free) policy gradient methods globally converge to the optimal solution and are efficient (polynomi- ' ally so in relevant problem dependent quantities) : With regards to their sample and computational complexities.},

abstract = {Physical contact events often allow a natural decomposition of manipulation tasks into action phases and subgoals. Within the motion primitive paradigm, each action phase corresponds to a motion primitive, and the subgoals correspond to the goal parameters of these primitives. Current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms are able to efficiently and robustly optimize the parameters of motion primitives in very high-dimensional problems. These algorithms often consider only shape parameters, which determine the trajectory between the start- and end-point of the movement. In manipulation, however, it is also crucial to optimize the goal parameters, which represent the subgoals between the motion primitives. We therefore extend the policy improvement with path integrals (PI2) algorithm to simultaneously optimize shape and goal parameters. Applying simultaneous shape and goal learning to sequences of motion primitives leads to the novel algorithm PI2 Seq. We use our methods to address a fundamental challenge in manipulation: improving the robustness of everyday pick-and-place tasks. {\textcopyright} 2004-2012 IEEE.},

We show how SLS shifts the controller synthesis task from the design of a controller to the design of the entire closed loop system, and highlight the benefits of this approach in terms of scalability and transparency. We emphasize two particular applications of SLS, namely large-scale distributed optimal control and robust control. In the case of distributed control, we show how SLS allows for localized controllers to be computed, extending robust and optimal control methods to large-scale systems under practical and realistic assumptions. In the case of robust control, we show how SLS allows for novel design methodologies that, for the first time, quantify the degradation in performance of a robust controller due to model uncertainty – such transparency is key in allowing robust control methods to interact, in a principled way, with modern techniques from machine learning and statistical inference. Throughout, we emphasize practical and efficient computational solutions, and demonstrate our methods on easy to understand case studies.},

abstract = {In this paper, a method to synthesize controllers using finite time convergence control barrier functions guided by linear temporal logic specifications for continuous time multi-agent dynamical systems is proposed. Finite time convergence to a desired set in the state space is guaranteed under the existence of a suitable finite time convergence control barrier function. In addition, these barrier functions also guarantee forward invariance once the system converges to the desired set. This allows us to formulate a theoretical framework which synthesizes controllers for the multi-agent system. These properties also enable us to solve the reachability problem in continuous time by formulating a theorem on the composition of multiple finite time convergence control barrier functions. This approach is more flexible than existing methods and also allows for a greater set of feasible control laws. Linear temporal logic is used to specify complex task specifications that need to be satisfied by the multi-agent system. With this solution methodology, a control law is synthesized that satisfies the given temporal logic task specification. Robotic experiments are provided which were performed on the Robotarium multi-robot testbed at Georgia Tech.},

On the other hand, the most popular system identification methods assume that all uncertainty is in the form of additive noise. This has hampered the application of robust control methods to practical problems. This paper begins to address the gap between the models used in control synthesis and those obtained from identification experi- ments by considering the connection between uncertain models and data. The model validation problem addressed here is: given experimental data and a model with both additive noise and norm-bounded perturbations, is it possible that the model could produce the observed input-output data? This problem is stud- ied for the standard H,/p framework models. A necessary condition for such a model to describe an experimental datum is obtained. Furthermore, for a large class of models, in the robust control framework, this condition is computable as the solution of a quadratic optimization problem.},

abstract = {Robust control theory studies the effect of noise, disturbances, and other uncertainty on system performance. Despite growing recognition across science and engineering that robustness and efficiency tradeoffs dominate the evolution and design of complex systems, the use of robust control theory remains limited, partly because the mathematics involved is relatively inaccessible to nonexperts, and the important concepts have been inexplicable without a fairly rich mathematics background. This paper aims to begin changing that by presenting the most essential concepts in robust control using human stick balancing, a simple case study popular in both the sensorimotor control literature and extremely familiar to engineers. With minimal and familiar models and mathematics, we can explore the impact of unstable poles and zeros, delays, and noise, which can then be easily verified with simple experiments using a standard extensible pointer. Despite its simplicity, this case study has extremes of robustness and fragility that are initially counter-intuitive but for which simple mathematics and experiments are clear and compelling. The theory used here has been well-known for many decades, and the cart-pendulum example is a standard in undergrad controls courses, yet a careful reconsidering of both leads to striking new insights that we argue are of great pedagogical value.},

Our analysis uses recent results from random matrix theory, self-normalized martingales and SVD robustness, in order to show that with high probability the estimation errors decrease with a rate of {\$}1/\backslashsqrt{\{}N{\}}{\$}.

Our lower bounds reveal that these upper bounds match up to logarithmic factors. In particular, we capture the correct signal-to-noise behavior of the problem, showing that more unstable linear systems are easier to estimate. This behavior is qualitatively different from arguments which rely on mixing-time calculations that suggest that unstable systems are more difficult to estimate.

We propose a multi-stage procedure, called Coarse-ID control, that estimates a model from a few experimental trials, estimates the error in that model with respect to the truth, and then designs a controller using both the model and uncertainty estimate. Our technique uses contemporary tools from random matrix theory to bound the error in the estimation procedure. We also employ a recently developed approach to control synthesis called System Level Synthesis that enables robust control design by solving a convex optimization problem. We provide end-to-end bounds on the relative error in control cost that are nearly optimal in the number of parameters and that highlight salient properties of the system to be controlled such as closed-loop sensitivity and optimal control magnitude. We show experimentally that the Coarse-ID approach enables efficient computation of a stabilizing controller in regimes where simple control schemes that do not take the model uncertainty into account fail to stabilize the true system.},

According to the literature (Barcia et. at., 1992) the electro-dissolution process leads to the existence of a viscosity gradient in the interface metal-solution, which leads to a velocity field quantitatively different form the one developed in uniform viscosity conditions and may affect the stability of the hydrodynamic field. The purpose of this work is to investigate whether a steady viscosity profile, depending on the distance to the electrode surface, affects the stability properties of the classic velocity field near a rotating disc. Two classes of perturbations are considered: perturbations monotonically varying along the radial direction, and perturbations periodically modulated along the radial direction. The results show that the hydrodynamic field is always stable with respect to the first class of perturbations and that the neutral stability curves are modified by the presence of a viscosity gradient in the second case, in the sense of reducing the critical Reynolds number beyond which perturbations are amplified. This result supports the hypothesis that the current oscillations observed in the polarization curve may originate from a hydrodynamic instability.},

This paper presents the first attempt in the field to rigorously formulate the extrusion sequence and motion planning (SAMP) problem, using a CSP encoding. Furthermore, this research proposes a new hierarchical planning framework to solve the extrusion SAMP problems that usually have a long planning horizon and 3D configuration complexity. By decoupling sequence and motion planning, the planning framework is able to efficiently solve the extrusion sequence, end-effector poses, joint configurations, and transition trajectories for spatial trusses with nonstandard topologies. This paper also presents the first detailed computation data to reveal the runtime bottleneck on solving SAMP problems, which provides insight and comparing baseline for future algorithmic development. Together with the algorithmic results, this paper also presents an open-source and modularized software implementation called Choreo that is machine-agnostic. To demonstrate the power of this algorithmic framework, three case studies, including real fabrication and simulation results, are presented.},

We address the problem of multi-agent cooperative manipulation, where we aim for jointly optimal paths for all agents and over the full manipulation sequence. This joint optimization problem can be framed as a logic-geometric program. Existing solvers lack several features (such as consistently handling kinematic switches) and efficiency to handle the cooperative manipulation domain. We propose a new approximate solver scheme, combining ideas from branch-and-bound and MCTS and exploiting multiple levels of bounds to better direct the search. We demonstrate the method in a scenario where a Baxter robot needs to help a human to reach for objects.},

The proposed planner finds the optimal solution by automatically permuting, evaluating, and searching the possible assembly sequences considering stability, graspability, and assemblability qualities.

abstract = {Through many recent successes in simulation, model-free reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising approach to solving continuous control robotic tasks. The research community is now able to reproduce, analyze and build quickly on these results due to open source implementations of learning algorithms and simulated benchmark tasks. To carry forward these successes to real-world applications, it is crucial to withhold utilizing the unique advantages of simulations that do not transfer to the real world and experiment directly with physical robots. However, reinforcement learning research with physical robots faces substantial resistance due to the lack of benchmark tasks and supporting source code. In this work, we introduce several reinforcement learning tasks with multiple commercially available robots that present varying levels of learning difficulty, setup, and repeatability. On these tasks, we test the learning performance of off-the-shelf implementations of four reinforcement learning algorithms and analyze sensitivity to their hyper-parameters to determine their readiness for applications in various real-world tasks. Our results show that with a careful setup of the task interface and computations, some of these implementations can be readily applicable to physical robots. We find that state-of-the-art learning algorithms are highly sensitive to their hyper-parameters and their relative ordering does not transfer across tasks, indicating the necessity of re-tuning them for each task for best performance. On the other hand, the best hyper-parameter configuration from one task may often result in effective learning on held-out tasks even with different robots, providing a reasonable default. We make the benchmark tasks publicly available to enhance reproducibility in real-world reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {Many exciting robotic applications require multiple robots with many degrees of freedom, such as manipulators, to coordinate their motion in a shared workspace. Discovering high-quality paths in such scenarios can be achieved, in principle, by exploring the composite space of all robots. Sampling-based planners do so by building a roadmap or a tree data structure in the corresponding configuration space and can achieve asymptotic optimality. The hardness of motion planning, however, renders the explicit construction of such structures in the composite space of multiple robots impractical. This work proposes a scalable solution for such coupled multi-robot problems, which provides desirable path-quality guarantees and is also computationally efficient. In particular, the proposed ????∗dRRT∗$\backslash$mathtt{\{}dRRT{\^{}}*{\}} is an informed, asymptotically-optimal extension of a prior sampling-based multi-robot motion planner, ????dRRT$\backslash$mathtt{\{}dRRT{\}}. The prior approach introduced the idea of building roadmaps for each robot and implicitly searching the tensor product of these structures in the composite space. This work identifies the conditions for convergence to optimal paths in multi-robot problems, which the prior method was not achieving. Building on this analysis, ????dRRT$\backslash$mathtt{\{}dRRT{\}} is first properly adapted so as to achieve the theoretical guarantees and then further extended so as to make use of effective heuristics when searching the composite space of all robots. The case where the various robots share some degrees of freedom is also studied. Evaluation in simulation indicates that the new algorithm, ????∗dRRT∗$\backslash$mathtt{\{}dRRT{\^{}}*{\}} converges to high-quality paths quickly and scales to a higher number of robots where various alternatives fail. This work also demonstrates the planner's capability to solve problems involving multiple real-world robotic arms.},

abstract = {Establishing adequate RF (Radio Frequency) connectivity is the basic requirement for the proper operation of any wireless network. In a mobile wireless network it is a challenge for applications and protocols to deal with connectivity problems, as links might get up and down frequently. In these scenarios, having knowledge of the node remaining connectivity time can avoid unnecessary or even unuseful control/data messages transmissions. The current paper presents the so-called Genetic Machine Learning Approach for Link Quality Prediction, or simply GMLA, which is a solution to forecast the remainder RF connectivity time in mobile environments. Differently from all related works, GMLA allows building connectivity knowledge to estimate the RF link duration without the need of a pre-runtime phase. This allows to apply GMLA at unknown environments and mobility patterns. Its structure combines a Classifier System with a Markov chain model of the RF link quality. As the Markov model parameters are discovered on-the-fly, there is no need of a previous history to feed the Markov model. Obtained simulation results show that GMLA is a very suitable solution, as it outperforms approaches that use geographical positioning systems (GPS) and also approaches that use link-quality prediction, such as BD and MTCP. GMLA is generic enough to be applied to any layer of the communication protocol stack, especially in the link and network layers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {This paper presents algorithms for solving structural topology optimization problems with uncertainty in the magnitude and location of the applied loads and with small uncertainty in the location of the structural nodes. The second type of uncertainty would typically arise from fabrication errors where the tolerances for the node locations are small in relation to the length scale of the structural elements. We first review the discrete form of the uncertain loads problem, which has been previously solved using a weighted average of multiple load patterns. With minor modifications, we extend this solution to include loads described by continuous joint probability density functions. We then proceed to the main contribution of this paper: structural optimization under uncertainty in the nodal locations. This optimization problem is computationally difficult because it involves variations of the inverse of the structural stiffness matrix. It is shown, however, that for small uncertainties the problem can be recast into a simpler but equivalent structural optimization problem with equivalent uncertain loads. By expressing these equivalent loads in terms of continuous random variables, we are able to make use of the extended form of the uncertain loads problem presented in the first part of this paper. The optimization algorithms are developed in the context of minimum compliance (maximum stiffness) design. Simple examples are presented. The results demonstrate that load and nodal uncertainties can have dramatic impact on optimal design. For structures containing thin substructures under axial loads, it is shown that these uncertainties (a) are of first-order significance, influencing the linear elastic response quantities, and (b) can affect designs by avoiding unrealistically optimistic and potentially unstable structures. The additional computational cost associated with the uncertainties scales linearly with the number of uncertainties and is insignificant compared to the cost associated with solving the deterministic structural optimization problem. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Author(s). Licensee InTech. Learning capabilities, often guided by competition/cooperation, play a fundamental and ubiquitous role in living beings. Moreover, several behaviours, such as feeding and courtship, involve environmental exploration and exploitation, including local competition, and lead to a global benefit for the colony. This can be considered as a form of global cooperation, even if the individual agent is not aware of the overall effect. This paper aims to demonstrate that identical biorobots, endowed with simple neural controllers, can evolve diversified behaviours and roles when competing for the same resources in the same arena. These behaviours also produce a benefit in terms of time and energy spent by the whole group. The robots are tasked with a classical foraging task structured through the cyclic activation of resources. The result is that each individual robot, while competing to reach the maximum number of available targets, tends to prefer a specific sequence of subtasks. This indirectly leads to the global result of task partitioning whereby the cumulative energy spent, in terms of the overall travelled distance and the time needed to complete the task, tends to be minimized. A series of simulation experiments is conducted using different numbers of robots and scenarios: the common emergent result obtained is the role-specialization of each robot. The description of the neural controller and the specialization mechanisms are reported in detail and discussed.},

This type of algorithm performs a Darwinian open-ended evolution where the individuals that make up the population are embodied in the physical robots and situated in an environment. The robots interact autonomously in an asynchronous fashion, leading to a complex dynamic system in continuous evolution with dependencies among parameters that make theoretical studies of specialization quite difficult in real cases. Consequently, the aim here is to perform a theoretical analysis of this type of embodied evolution based algorithms, establishing a set of canonical parameters that define their operation. A generic algorithm of this type is designed that allows us to formally study the relevance of the canonical parameters. In this paper this study concentrates on specialization for the construction of heterogeneous robotic teams. The conclusions obtained in the theoretical framework are confirmed in a real multi-robot collective gathering task using one of the many real embodied evolution based algorithms and showing that two canonical parameters are the most relevant in terms of specialization for this type of algorithms. Some insights into how to adjust these canonical parameters in a real problem are provided. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Specifically, we consider the stick-pulling problem first proposed by Martinoli et al., and develop a macroscopic analytical model for the swarm executing a set of tasks that require the collaboration of two robots. We show, for constant external conditions, maximum productivity can be achieved by a single species swarm with carefully chosen operational parameters. While the same applies for a two species swarm, we show how specialization is a strategy best employed for changing external conditions.},

abstract = {Designing effective behavioral controllers for mobile robots can be difficult and tedious; this process can be circumvented by using online learning techniques which allow robots to generate their own controllers online in an automated fashion. In multi-robot systems, robots operating in parallel can potentially learn at a much faster rate by sharing information amongst themselves. In this work, we use an adapted version of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm in order to accomplish distributed online robotic learning in groups of robots with access to only local information. The effectiveness of the learning technique on a benchmark task (generating high-performance obstacle avoidance behavior) is evaluated for robot groups of various sizes, with the maximum group size allowing each robot to individually contain and manage a single PSO particle. To increase the realism of the technique, different PSO neighborhoods based on limitations of real robotic communication are tested and compared in this scenario. We explore the effect of varying communication power for one of these communication-based PSO neighborhoods. To validate the effectiveness of these learning techniques, fully distributed online learning experiments are run using a group of 10 real robots, generating results which support the findings from our simulations.},

They also extended the stick-pulling problem to require k robots collaborating to successfully pull a stick. They tested the same and found similar results for this generalization.

abstract = {Robust control maintains stability and performance for a fixed amount of model uncertainty but can be conservative since the model is not updated online. Learning-based control, on the other hand, uses data to improve the model over time but is not typically guaranteed to be robust throughout the process. This paper proposes a novel combination of both ideas: a robust Min-Max Learning-Based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MM-LB-NMPC) algorithm. Based on an existing LB-NMPC algorithm, we present an efficient and robust extension, altering the NMPC performance objective to optimize for the worst-case scenario. The algorithm uses a simple a priori vehicle model and a learned disturbance model. Disturbances are modelled as a Gaussian Process (GP) based on experience collected during previous trials as a function of system state, input, and other relevant variables. Nominal state sequences are predicted using an Unscented Transform and worst-case scenarios are defined as sequences bounding the 3{\&}{\#}x03C3; confidence region. Localization for the controller is provided by an on-board, vision-based mapping and navigation system enabling operation in large-scale, GPS-denied environments. The paper presents experimental results from testing on a 50 kg skid-steered robot executing a path-tracking task. The results show reductions in maximum lateral and heading path-tracking errors by up to 30{\%} and a clear transition from robust control when the model uncertainty is high to optimal control when model uncertainty is reduced.},

The core idea in AutoMoDe recalls the approach commonly adopted in machine learning for dealing with the bias-variance tradedoff: to obtain suitably general solutions with low variance, an appropriate design bias is injected. AutoMoDe produces robot control software by selecting, instantiating, and combining preexisting parametric modules-the injected bias. The resulting control software is a probabilistic finite state machine in which the topology, the transition rules and the values of the parameters are obtained automatically via an optimization process that maximizes a task-specific objective function. As a proof of concept, we define AutoMoDe-Vanilla, which is a specialization of AutoMoDe for the e-puck robot. We use AutoMoDe-Vanilla to design the robot control software for two different tasks: aggregation and foraging. The results show that the control software produced by AutoMoDe-Vanilla (i) yields good results, (ii) appears to be robust to the so called reality gap, and (iii) is naturally human-readable. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

In addition to the external shape of a module configuration, the internal arrangement of modules and bonds between them can greatly impact functionally relevant mechanical properties such as load bearing ability. A fast method to evaluate the mechanical property aids the search for an arrangement of modules achieving a desired mechanical property as the space of possible configurations grows combinatorially. We present a fast approximate method where the bonds between modules are represented with stiffness matrices that are general enough to represent a wide variety of systems and follows the natural modular decomposition of the system. The method includes nonlinear modeling such as anisotropic bonds and properties that vary as components flex. We show that the arrangement of two types of bonds within a programmable matter systems enables programming the apparent elasticity of the structure. We also present a method to experimentally determine the stiffness matrix for chain style reconfigurable robots. The efficacy of applying the method is demonstrated on the CKBot modular robot and two programmable matter systems: the Rubik's snake folding chain toy and a right angle tetrahedron chain called RATChET7mm.

The robotic cameras share information for their controllers over a wireless network using a specially designed multihop networking algorithm. The control strategy is demonstrated in repeated experiments with three flying quadrotor robots indoors, and with five flying quadrotor robots outdoors. Simulation results for more complex scenarios are also presented.},

abstract = {Complex systems are characterized by many independent components whose low-level actions produce collective high-level results. Predicting high-level results given low-level rules is a key open challenge; the inverse problem, finding low-level rules that give specific outcomes, is in general still less understood. We present a multi-agent construction system inspired by mound-building termites, solving such an inverse problem. A user specifies a desired structure, and the system automatically generates low-level rules for independent climbing robots that guarantee production of that structure. Robots use only local sensing and coordinate their activity via the shared environment. We demonstrate the approach via a physical realization with three autonomous climbing robots limited to onboard sensing. This work advances the aim of engineering complex systems that achieve specific human-designed goals.},

abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can learn complex robotic skills from raw sensory inputs, but have yet to achieve the kind of broad generalization and applicability demonstrated by deep learning methods in supervised domains. We present a deep RL method that is practical for real-world robotics tasks, such as robotic manipulation, and generalizes effectively to never-before-seen tasks and objects. In these settings, ground truth reward signals are typically unavailable, and we therefore propose a self-supervised model-based approach, where a predictive model learns to directly predict the future from raw sensory readings, such as camera images. At test time, we explore three distinct goal specification methods: designated pixels, where a user specifies desired object manipulation tasks by selecting particular pixels in an image and corresponding goal positions, goal images, where the desired goal state is specified with an image, and image classifiers, which define spaces of goal states. Our deep predictive models are trained using data collected autonomously and continuously by a robot interacting with hundreds of objects, without human supervision. We demonstrate that visual MPC can generalize to never-before-seen objects---both rigid and deformable---and solve a range of user-defined object manipulation tasks using the same model.},

abstract = {Self-reconfigurable robots are built from modules which are autonomously able to change the way they are connected, thus changing the overall shape of the robot. This process is difficult to control because it involves the distributed coordination of large numbers of identical modules connected in time-varying ways. We present an approach to self-reconfiguration where the desired configuration is grown from an initial seed module. Seeds produce growth by creating a recruitment gradient, using local communication, which spare modules climb to locate the seed. The growth is guided by a novel representation of the desired configuration, which is automatically generated from a 3D CAD model. This approach has two salient features: (1) the representation is concise, with a size proportional to the global shape rather than the number of modules and (2) there is a clean separation between the goal and the local, goal independent rules used by the modules. We demonstrate three implementations of the local rules for recruitment, and show how one can trade-off the number of moves and messages, against time taken to reconfigure. $\backslash$n},

In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for the analysis of internal wrenches based on the kinematic constraints imposed to the manipulator ensemble. We unify previous results by showing that there exists no unique nonsqueezing load distribution and illustrate the consequences of our findings by means of several examples. In particular, the presented results provide a new perspective on the decomposition of interaction forces into internal and external components as required for cooperative multimanipulator control schemes.},

abstract = {As robots move beyond manufacturing applications to less predictable en-vironments, they can increasingly benefit, as animals do, from integrating sensing and control with the passive properties provided by particular com-binations and arrangements of materials and mechanisms. This realization is partly responsible for the recent proliferation of soft and bioinspired robots. Tuned materials and mechanisms can provide several kinds of benefits, in-cluding energy storage and recovery, increased physical robustness, and de-creased response time to sudden events. In addition, they may offer passive open-loop behaviors and responses to external changes in loading or envi-ronmental conditions. Collectively, these properties can also increase the stability of a robot as it interacts with the environment and allow the closed-loop controller to reduce the apparent degrees of freedom subject to control. The design of appropriate materials and mechanisms remains a challenging problem; bioinspiration, genetic algorithms, and numerical shape and mater-ials optimization are all applicable. New multimaterial fabrication processes are also steadily increasing the range and magnitude of passive properties available for intrinsically responsive robots.},

The elements are designed to be inserted and removed singly in ldquorandom access,rdquo thus eliminating some assembly order constraints and enabling a physical realization of the construction process. The proposed robot is a ldquohingerdquo robot that can demonstrate manipulating said elements. The robot is also designed to be able to traverse arbitrary scale truss structures. With the addition of reconfiguration algorithms discussed by Lobo in [1], we suggest that such reconfigurable structures and robots could open the door to a machine metabolic process where structures are decomposed and recomposed autonomously to meet varying needs to a variety of applications from infrastructure recovery to space exploration.},

abstract = {The modular walking machine Octavio is a bio-inspired robot designed to serve as a testbed for modular neural locomotion control. It consists of up to eight control- and energy-autonomous leg modules, each equipped with 3 active and 2 passive compliant joints and various proprioceptive sensors. Legs may be either used in single leg (treadmill) experiments or can be quickly attached to and detached from bodies with different morphologies. Body morphologies include 4-, 6- and 8-legged machines. Neurocybernetic control is developed and optimized using evolutionary techniques together with a physical simulation of the machine and its environment. This article gives an overview of the machines mechanics, electronics, firmware, configuration and control software. Simple examples demonstrate how the behavior of the simulated and the physical machines are controlled by e.g. neurobiologically motivated modular neural networks. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Biological brains can adapt and learn from past experience. In neuroevolution, i.e. evolving artificial neural networks (ANNs), one way that agents controlled by ANNs can evolve the ability to adapt is by encoding local learning rules. However, a significant problem with most such approaches is that local learning rules for every connection in the network must be discovered separately. This paper aims to show that learning rules can be effectively indirectly encoded by extending the Hypercube-based NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (Hy- perNEAT) method. Adaptive HyperNEAT is introduced to allow not only patterns of weights across the connectivity of an ANN to be gener- ated by a function of its geometry, but also patterns of arbitrary learning rules. Several such adaptive models with different levels of generality are explored and compared. The long-term promise of the new approach is to evolve large-scale adaptive ANNs, which is a major goal for neuroevo- lution.},

abstract = {The ATRON self-reconfigurable robot consists of simple interconnected modules. Modules move relative to other modules and as a result change the shape of the robot. The ATRON modules are difficult to control because of complex motion constraints on the modules. Motion constraints are reduced by using meta-modules composed of three modules. A meta-module may emerge from unstructured groups of modules if three modules are connected in the right configuration. The meta-module then moves on a surface of modules and stop at another position. To attract moving meta-modules and thereby to specify the shape-changing task of the robot we use attraction-points. In this work we evolve a distributed artificial neural network controller for the modules. The controller is identical on every module and controls when a meta-module emerges, how it move and when it stops. In simulation we demonstrate how this control strategy allows the ATRON robot to shape-change to support an unstable roof, build a bridge across a gap and to self-repair a broken bone. We conclude that the control strategy is able to shape-change and self-repair the ATRON robot independent on whether it consists of dozens, hundreds or thousands of modules.},

abstract = {We present a decentralized algorithmic approach to automatically building user-specified three-dimensional structures from modular units. Our bipartite system comprises passive units (blocks), responsible for embodying the structure and determining where further units can legally be attached, and active units (robots), responsible for transporting passive units. The algorithmic issues are correspondingly decomposed into two parts: (1) deciding where passive units may be attached; and (2) getting them to those locations. For the first part, we give simple, scalable rules for attachment and prove that they will reliably lead to the construction of any desired structure from a large class of three-dimensional shapes. For the second part, we compare three approaches: random movement, systematic search and gradient-following; each approach is successively faster but requires more communication overhead and/or unit capabilities. The system we describe enables guaranteed construction of desired structures using very simple agent algorithms, taking a high-level specification as the only required input. The topic of collective construction is related to the problems of programmed self-assembly and self-reconfiguration in modular robots, and the rules governing block attachment presented here may be usefully applied to such systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the challenge of realizing full-body behaviors in scalable modular robots. We present an experimental study of a biologically inspired approach to organize the morphology and control of modular robots. The approach introduces a nested hierarchy that decomposes the complexity of assembling and commanding a functional robot made of numerous simple modules. The purpose is to support versatility, scalability, and provide design abstraction. The robots we describe incorporate anatomy-inspired parts such as muscles, bones, and joints, and these parts in turn are assembled from modules. Each of those parts encapsulates one or more functions, e. g., a muscle can contract. Control of the robot can then be cast as a problem of controlling its anatomical parts rather than each discrete module. To validate this approach, we perform experiments with micron-scale spherical catom modules in simulation. The robots we simulate are increasingly complex and include snake, crawler, quadruped, cilia surface, arm-joint-muscle, and grasping robots. We conclude that this is a promising approach for future microscopic many-modules systems, but also that it is not applicable to relatively weak and slow homogeneous systems such as the centimeter-scale ATRON.  2010 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

Reconfiguration is achieved using active module locomotion or manipulation. Here we propose a form of self-reconfigurable robotics based on passive, stochastic self-organization. Solid-state cellular units exploit "Brownian motion" in their environment and require no local power or locomotion ability. This form of reconfiguration avoids many of the barriers that prevent self-reconfigurable robotics from extending to large numbers and small scales. We demonstrate working prototypes and discuss preliminary analytical and computational models for analyzing the scalability of this concept.},

abstract = {Construction is difficult to automate because of its complexity. Introducing modularity into both structural components and a means of assembly solves the problem by simplifying the construction task. Based on this idea, we propose a novel concept of a fully automated construction system called the Automatic Modular Assembly System (AMAS). In this paper, we discuss the hardware system and distributed control method of AMAS. This system uses passive building blocks called "structure modules" and an assembler robot that is specialized to handle them. This "modular" concept drastically simplifies structural complexity. We have built a prototype model to evaluate its automatic construction capability. Then we introduce a distributed autonomous control for AMAS, which uses a gradient field to indicate the directions to the assembler robots. The gradient field is generated on the structure modules. To improve the efficiency, we introduce collision avoidance rules such as module relay and local negotiation via a blackboard. We also evaluate the overall performance of the distributed control with simulations.},

An environment characterization algorithm identifies features in the environment that can be augmented to create a path between two disconnected regions of the environment. Specially-designed building blocks enable the robot to create structures that can augment the environment to make obstacles traversable. A high-level planner reasons about the task, robot locomotion capabilities, and environment to decide if and where to augment the environment in order to perform the desired task.

Furthermore, robot built structures can be constructed in environments such as surface of Mars or in micro-gravity, which would otherwise be too time consuming or dangerous for humans. In this paper we discuss some of the mechanical design challenges of developing a passive robotically-reconfigurable truss system, and present the concept of the factory floor, which can construct truss-like structures without climbing on them. In the proposed system, each level is constructed on a ground plane using a truss and node configuration and is elevated to make room for the next level. This process is repeated to create 3D truss structures or reversed to decompose the structure for the next task.},

By adopting a modular approach, robots with different capabilities, shapes, and sizes could, in theory, construct and reconfigure themselves as required.

Here, we present robots whose bodies and control systems can merge to form entirely new robots that retain full sensorimotor control. Our control paradigm enables robots to exhibit properties that go beyond those of any existing machine or of any biological organism: the robots we present can merge to form larger bodies with a single centralized controller, split into separate bodies with independent controllers, and self-heal by removing or replacing malfunctioning body parts. This work takes us closer to robots that can autonomously change their size, form and function.},

The control law is adaptive in that it uses sensor measurements to learn the distribu- tion of sensory information in the environment.

The controller is then improved by introducing a consensus algorithm to propagate sensory information from every robot throughout the network. Con- vergence and consensus of parameters is proven with a Lyapunov- type proof. The controller with and without consensus is demonstrated in numerical simulations. These techniques are suggestive of broader applications of adaptive control methodologies to decentralized con- trol problems in unknown dynamic environments.},

In a completely new approach to understanding DIBs, we combined information from nearly 500,000 stellar spectra obtained by the massive spectroscopic survey RAVE (Radial Velocity Experiment) to produce the first pseudo-three-dimensional map of the strength of the DIB at 8620 angstroms covering the nearest 3 kiloparsecs from the Sun, and show that it follows our independently constructed spatial distribution of extinction by interstellar dust along the Galactic plane. Despite having a similar distribution in the Galactic plane, the DIB 8620 carrier has a significantly larger vertical scale height than the dust. Even if one DIB may not represent the general DIB population, our observations outline the future direction of DIB research.},

abstract = {T he field of modular self-reconfigurable robotic systems addresses the design, fabrication , motion planning, and control of autonomous kinematic machines with variable morphology. Beyond conventional actuation, sensing, and control typically found in fixed-morphology robots, self-reconfigurable robots are also able to deliberately change their own shape by rearranging the connectivity of their parts in order to adapt to new circumstances, perform new tasks, or recover from damage. Over the last two decades, the field of modular robotics has advanced from proof-of-concept systems to elaborate physical implementations and simulations. Modular robots are usually composed of multiple building blocks of a relatively small repertoire, with uniform docking interfaces that allow transfer of mechanical forces and moments, electrical power, and communication throughout the robot. The modular building blocks often consist of some primary structural actuated unit and potentially some additional specialized units such as grippers, feet, wheels, cameras, payload, and energy storage and generation units. Figure 1 illustrates such a system in the context of a potential application. Modular self-reconfigurable robotic systems can be generally classified into several architectural groups by the geometric arrangement of their units. Several systems exhibit hybrid properties. ◆ Lattice Architectures: Lattice architectures have units that are arranged and connected in some regular, three-dimensional pattern, such as a simple cubic or hexagonal grid. Control and motion can be executed in parallel. Lattice architectures usually offer simpler reconfiguration, as modules move to a discrete set of neighboring locations in which motions can be made open-loop. The computational representation can also be more easily scaled to more complex systems.},

In this paper, we present a custom 3D printer and an extrusion mechanism capable of 3D printing soft functional robots. Moreover, we compare the performance differences between our 3D printed soft robots and molded counterparts via lamination casting and lost wax casting.

Yet, it remains an open question as to how to program large swarms of robotic modules so that the assembly task is performed as efficiently as possible. Moreover, the problem of designing assembly algorithms is compounded by the scale of these systems, and by the lack of centralized guidance in unstructured environments. The main contribution of this work is a decentralized algorithm to assemble structures with modular robots. Importantly, we coordinate the robots so that docking actions can be parallelized. We show the correctness of our algorithm, and we demonstrate its scalability and generality through multiple scenarios in simulation.

Yet, it is still poorly understood and as such its full power remains underappre-ciated. The present paper clarifies the issue by defining stigmergy as a mechanism of indirect coordination in which the trace left by an action in a medium stimulates subsequent actions. It then analyses the fundamental concepts used in the definition: action, agent, med-ium, trace and coordination. It clarifies how stigmergy enables complex, coordinated activity without any need for planning, control, communication, simultaneous presence, or even mutual awareness. The resulting self-organization is driven by a combination of positive and negative feedbacks, amplifying beneficial developments while suppressing errors. Thus, stigmergy is applicable to a very broad vari-ety of cases, from chemical reactions to bodily coordination and Internet-supported collaboration in Wikipedia.},

abstract = {Many in the computer vision community have written papers on solving the " problem " of jigsaw puzzles for decades. Many of the former papers written cite the po-tential extension of this work to other more serious endeav-ors like reconstructing archaeological artifacts or fitting to-gether scanned objects while others simply do it because it's an interesting application of computer vision concepts. This author falls in the latter camp. Several methods for constructing jigsaw puzzles from images of the pieces were considered from a theoretical standpoint before the comput-ing power and the high-resolution image capturing devices necessary to employ these methods could be fully realized. More recently, many algorithms and methods tend toward disregarding piece shape as a discriminant entirely by us-ing " square pieces " and rely instead on the underlying im-age properties to find a solution. The jigsaw puzzle solver described in this paper falls somewhere in between these two extremes. The author of this project paper describes the creation of an " automatic " jigsaw puzzle solving pro-gram that relies on multiple concepts from computer vision as well as past work in the area to assemble puzzles from a single image of the disassembled pieces. While the pro-gram is currently specifically tailored to solve rectangular puzzles with " canonical " puzzle pieces, concepts learned from this work can be used in concert with other computer vision advances to enhance the puzzle solver and make it more robust to varying piece and puzzle shape. The puzzle solver created for this purpose is fairly unique in that it uses a picture of the disassembled pieces as input, no reference to the original puzzle image, and is done using the Mat-lab Image Processing Toolbox. The solver created for this project was successfully used on five separate puzzles with different rectangular bounds and dissimilar puzzle images. These results are similar to others who have created simi-lar puzzle solvers in the past. Ultimately, the author hopes that this work could lay the groundwork for a smart phone application.},

Here, we present robots whose bodies and control systems can merge to form entirely new robots that retain full sensorimotor control. Our control paradigm enables robots to exhibit properties that go beyond those of any existing machine or of any biological organism: the robots we present can merge to form larger bodies with a single centralized controller, split into separate bodies with independent controllers, and self-heal by removing or replacing malfunctioning body parts.

However, mobile soft robots are typically fabricated using laborious molding processes that result in lim-ited actuated degrees of freedom and hence limited locomotion capabilities. In this paper, we present a 3D printed robot with bellowed soft legs capable of rotation about two axes. This allows our robot to navigate rough terrain that previously posed a significant challenge to soft robots. We present models and FEM simulations for the soft leg modules and predict the robot locomotion capabilities. We use finite element analysis to simulate the actuation characteristics of these modules. We then compared the analytical and computational results to ex-perimental results with a tethered prototype. The experimental soft robot is capable of lifting its legs 5.3 cm off the ground and is able to walk at speeds up to 20 mm/s (0.13 bl/s).

Layers are made up of asynchronous modules which communicate over low bandwidth channels. Each module is an instance of a fairly simple computational machine. Higher level layers can subsume the roles of lower levels by suppressing their outputs. However, lower levels continue to function as higher levels are added. The result is a robust and flexible robot control system. The system is intended to control a robot that wanders the office areas of our laboratory, building maps of its surroundings.

abstract = {A Novel Concept for the Study of Heterogeneous Robotic Swarms warm robotics systems are characterized by decentral-ized control, limited commu-nication between robots, use of local information, and emergence of global behavior. Such sys-tems have shown their potential for flexibility and robustness [1]–[3]. However, existing swarm robotics sys-tems are by and large still limited to displaying simple proof-of-concept behaviors under laboratory conditions. It is our contention that one of the fac-tors holding back swarm robotics research is the almost universal insis-tence on homogeneous system compo-nents. We believe that swarm robotics designers must embrace heterogene-ity if they ever want swarm robotics systems to approach the complexity required of real-world systems. To date, swarm robotics systems have almost exclusively comprised physi-cally and behaviorally undifferentiated agents. This design decision has its roots in ethological models of self-organizing natural systems. These models serve as inspiration for swarm robotics system designers, but are often highly abstract simplifications of natural systems and, to date, have largely assumed homogeneous agents. Selected dynamics of the systems under study are shown to emerge from the interactions of identical system components, ignoring the heterogeneities (physical, spatial, functional, and informational) that one can find in almost any natural system. The field of swarm robotics currently lacks methods and tools with which to study and leverage the heterogeneity that is present in natural sys-tems. To remedy this deficiency, we propose swarmanoid, an innovative swarm robotics system composed of three different robot types with com-plementary skills: foot-bots are small autonomous robots specialized in moving on both even and uneven terrains, capable of self-assembling and of transporting objects or other robots; hand-bots are autonomous robots capable of climbing some vertical surfaces and manipulating small objects; and eye-bots are autonomous flying robots that can attach to an indoor ceil-ing, capable of analyzing the environment from a privileged position to},

abstract = {Real-world applications that are ideal for robotic solutions are very
complex and challenging. Many of these applications are set in dynamic environments
that require capabilities distributed in functionality, space, or time.
These applications, therefore, often require teams of robots to work together cooperatively
to successfully address the mission. While much research in recent
years has addressed the issues of autonomous robots and multi-robot cooperation,
current robotics technology is still far from achieving many of these real
world applications. We believe that two primary reasons for this technology
gap are that (1) previous work has not adequately addressed the issues of fault
tolerance and adaptivity in multi-robot teams, and (2) existing robotics research
is often geared at specic applications, and is not easily generalized to
dierent, but related, applications. This paper addresses these issues by rst
describing the design issues of key importance in these real-world cooperative
robotics applications | fault tolerance, reliability, adaptivity, and coherence.
We then present a general architecture addressing these design issues | called
ALLIANCE | that facilitates multi-robot cooperation of small- to mediumsized
teams in dynamic environments, performing missions composed of loosely
coupled subtasks. We illustrate the generality of this architecture by describing
two very dierent proof-of-concept implementations of this architecture: a
janitorial service mission, and a bounding overwatch mission.},

Successful solutions to forming pickup teams will enable researchers to experiment with larger numbers of robots and enable industry to efficiently and cost-effectively integrate new robot technology with existing legacy teams. In this paper, we define the challenge of pickup teams and propose the treasure hunt domain for evaluating the performance of pickup teams. Additionally, we describe a basic implementation of a pickup team that can search and discover treasure in a previously unknown environment. We build on prior approaches in market-based task allocation and plays for synchronized task execution, to allocate roles amongst robots in the pickup team, and to execute synchronized team actions to accomplish the treasure hunt task.},

abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots equipped with arms have the potential to be used for automated construction of structures in various sizes and shapes, such as houses or other infrastructures. Existing construction processes, like many other additive manufacturing processes, are mostly based on precise positioning, which is achieved by machines that have a fixed mechanical link with the construction and therefore relying on absolute positioning. Mobile robots, by nature, do not have a fixed referential point, and their positioning systems are not as accurate as fixed-based systems. Therefore, mobile robots have to employ new technologies and/or methods to implement precise construction processes. In contrast to the majority of prior work on autonomous construction that has relied only on external tracking systems (e.g., GPS) or exclusively on short-range relative localization (e.g., stigmergy), this paper explores localization methods based on a combination of long-range self-positioning and short-range relative localization for robots to construct precise, separated artifacts in particular situations, such as in outer space or in indoor environments, where external support is not an option. Achieving both precision and autonomy in construction tasks requires understanding the environment and physically interacting with it. Consequently, we must evaluate the robot's key capabilities of navigation and manipulation for performing the construction in order to analyze the impact of these capabilities on a predefined construction. In this paper, we focus on the precision of autonomous construction of separated artifacts. This domain motivates us to combine two methods used for the construction: 1) a self-positioning system and 2) a short-distance relative localization. We evaluate our approach on a miniature mobile robot that autonomously maps an environment using a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm; the robot's objective is then to manipulate blocks to build desired artifacts based on a plan given by a human. Our results illuminate practical issues for future applications that also need to integrate complex tasks under mobile robot constraints.},

This paper presents a cable-driven robot called SPIDERobot, that was developed for automated construction of architectural projects. This robot has a rotating claw and it is controlled by a set of 4 cables that allow 4 degrees of freedom. In addition to the robot, this paper introduces a Dynamic Control System (DCS) that controls the positioning of the robot and assures that the length of cables is always within a safe value. Results show that traditional force-feasible approaches are more influenced by the pulling forces or the geometric arrangement of all cables and their positioning is significantly less accurate than the DCS. Therefore, the architecture of the SPIDERobot is designed to enable an easily scaling up of the solution to higher dimensions for operating in realistic environments.},

The control algorithm guides the robot to build the structure without relying on external motion capture systems or on external computers. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system, real-robot experiments were carried out. In each of them, the robot successfully built the structure. We propose a statistical model to represent the structures built with deformable pockets, and we provide a set of criteria for assessing the performance of the proposed system. The results show the viability of the proposed autonomous construction system in accomplishing the task.},

This is mainly due to the unstructured nature of construction sites and the fact that the structures built must be larger than the machines which build them. This paper addresses these difficulties by presenting a repositioning and localization system which, using purely on-board sensing, allows a mobile robot to maintain a high degree of end-effector positioning accuracy while moving among numerous building positions during a building task. We introduce a newly developed machine, called the In situ Fabricator (IF), whose goal is to bring digital fabrication to the construction site. The capabilities of the repositioning and localization system is demonstrated through the construction of a vertical stack of bricks, in which the IF repositions itself after placing each brick. With this experiment, we demonstrate that the IF can build with sub-centimeter accuracy over long building sequences.},

They employ templates (or patterns) in the environment to guide construction tasks and robot swarms can use similar mechanisms. Early work examined how a spatio-temporal varying template can be utilized by a swarm of minimalist robots to build the framework for a linear wall. From this, it became clear that a method for regulating construction in a variable environment was needed. To this end, a social insect inspired distributed feedback mechanism is proposed and verified. Direct and indirect transfer of information between individuals, through the use of signals and cues, is shown to facilitate closure of a feedback loop allowing the system to operate close to optimally. Perturbation experiments demonstrate the robotic swarm's ability to adapt to environmental changes. The work described in this paper provides the basis for a distributed robotic system capable of constructing any given planar structure - a goal implicit in many of the suggested applications for collective construction.

abstract = {—After a terrible disaster such as an earthquake or a nuclear accident, finding victims and isolating them from hazards are usually the first priorities for rescuers. As the security of rescuers and the stabilization of the environment are critical components of the first rescue phase, we assume that robots could be used to secure the environment by performing construction tasks, to stabilize large structures, and/or protect the victims. In this paper we suggest an approach consisting of using mobile robots to construct protective walls on a site affected by a nuclear disaster. Protective walls can help to block radiation from toxic sources and protect both victims and rescuers. On the other hand, the robot's vulnerability to radiation restricts its freedom of movements into unsafe regions. Therefore, building protective walls needs a plan (construction plan) that involves three competing objectives: victim safety, rescuer safety, and robot safety. Weighting these factors is a societal choice, is not trivial, and impacts the whole system. In this paper, we provide and optimize the construction plan using a genetic algorithm based on three objectives. We analyze the construction plan performance with respect to execution time. We also analyze the trade-offs involved between these competing objectives in different environments with ranging physical complexity (e.g., a number of victims or sources).},

abstract = {Dry stone constructions date as far back as 9000 BC and are associated with the first stable human settlements in the cradle of human civilization. Agricultural tools and permanent settlements led to sustained domestication of crops, and consequently a continuous co-evolution of humans and their environment. The tools adopted widely by contemporary society are related to processing and visualizing information. It has been suggested that based on the information gathered from the environment, architecture itself could become responsive to the real environment. This research seeks to attain a constant modification of the built environment on a small scale, rather than a large scale stepwise engagement. We suggest that representations of information should be closely coupled with the built environment, and that the built environment should be conjoined in real-time communication with multiple different representations, enabling sense-making and suggesting potential future states. Through physical construction and design experimentation, representations of potential modifications, or articulations, are overlaid onto the environment. It is however important that these articulations be in constant flux based on the ongoing communication between environment and representations of it. We propose a computational material supported by a framework that would link computation and environment in constant bi-directional communication and continuous, stepwise development. We propose a methodology composed of scanning the environment, real-time computation, guidance, and construction visualization that would lead to a new approach of evolving the digital into a new physical reality. Future mixed reality architecture applications could make use of computational composites in order to fuse design and construction.},

Here, we present a testbed designed to explore how emergent structures can be assembled using swarms of active robots manipulating passive building blocks in two dimensions. The robot swarm is based on the toy “bristlebot”; a simple vibrating motor mounted on top of bristles to propel the body forward. Since shape largely determines the details of physical interactions, the robot behavior is altered by carefully designing its geometry instead of uploading a digital program. Through this mechanical programming, we plan to investigate how to tune emergent structural properties such as the size and temporal stability of assemblies. Alongside a physical testbed with 200 robots, this work involves comprehensive simulation and analysis tools. This simple, reliable platform will help provide better insight on how to coordinate large swarms of robots to construct functional structures.},

abstract = {Six-legged pedestrians, cockroaches, use a running gait during locomotion. The gait was defined by measuring ground reaction forces and mechanical energy fluctuations of the center of mass in Blaberus discoidalis (Serville) as they travelled over a miniature force platform. These six-legged animals produce horizontal and vertical ground-reaction patterns of force similar to those found in two-, four- and eight-legged runners. Lateral forces were less than half the vertical force fluctuations. At speeds between 0.08 and 0.66 ms-1, horizontal kinetic and gravitational potential energy changes were in phase. This pattern of energy fluctuation characterizes the bouncing gaits used by other animals that run. Blaberus discoidalis attained a maximum sustainable stride frequency of 13 Hz at 0.35 ms-1, the same speed and frequency predicted for a mammal of the same mass. Despite differences in body form, the mass-specific energy used to move the center of mass a given distance (0.9 J kg-1m-1) was the same for cockroaches, ghost crabs, mammals, and birds. Similarities in force production, stride frequency and mechanical energy production during locomotion suggest that there may be common design constraints in terrestrial locomotion which scale with body mass and are relatively independent of body form, leg number and skeletal type.},

abstract = {To assess energetic costs during rest and locomotion in a small insect, we measured metabolic rate in freely moving ants Camponotus sp. (average body mass 11.9 mg). The animals ran in a straight respirometric chamber in which locomotor speed and CO2 release were monitored simultaneously using flow-through respirometry and conventional video analysis. In resting intact ants, standard metabolic rate was on average 0.32 ml CO2 g(-1) body mass h(-1). During walking, the ants breathed continuously and metabolic rate increased between 4.3 times (level walking at 0-5 mm s(-1)) and 6.9 times (30 degrees ascent at 85-95 mm s(-1)) over resting rates. Metabolic rate increased linearly with increasing walking speed but superficially leveled off beyond speeds of about 70 mm s(-1). Walking on incline (uphill) or decline slopes (downhill) of up to 60 degrees had only a small effect on energy consumption compared to level walking. During slope walking, total metabolic rate averaged over all running speeds ranged from a minimum of 1.55+/-0.4 (horizontal running) to a maximum of 1.89+/-0.7 ml CO2 h(-1) g(-1) body mass (30 degrees downhill). The mean cost of transport in Camponotus was approximately 130 J g(-1) km(-1). The metabolic requirements in the comparatively small insect Camponotus for walking were mostly in the range expected from data obtained from other insects and small poikilotherms, and from allometric scaling laws.},

abstract = {New models and theories of legged locomotion are needed to better explain and predict the robustly stable legged locomotion of animals and some bio-inspired robots. In this paper we observe that a hip-torque and leg-damping mechanism is fundamental to many legged robots and some animals and determine its affect on locomotion dynamics. We discuss why this hip-torque-and-leg-damping mechanism is not so easily understood. We investigate how hip-torque and leg-damping affect the stability and robustness of locomotion using a mathematical model: First, we extend the canonical spring-loaded-inverted-pendulum model to include constant hip torque and leg damping proportional to leg length speed. Then, we calculate the stability and robustness of locomotion as a function of increasing levels of torque and damping, starting from zero-the energy conserving and marginally stable special case-to high levels of torque and damping. We find that the stabilizing effects of hip-torque and leg-damping occur in the context of the piecewise-continuous dynamics of legged locomotion, and so linear intuition does not apply. We discover that adding hip torque and leg damping changes the stability of legged locomotion in an unexpected way. When a small amount of torque and damping are added, legged locomotion is initially destabilized. As more torque and damping are added, legged locomotion turns stable and becomes increasingly more stable and more robust the more torque and damping are added. Also, stable locomotion becomes more probable over the biologically-relevant region of the parameter space, indicating greater prediction and explanatory capabilities of the model. These results provide a more clear understanding of the hip-torque-and-leg-damping mechanism of legged locomotion, and extend existing theory of legged locomotion towards a greater understanding of robustly stable locomotion.},

abstract = {The spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) has emerged as the "right" template for studying dynamic locomotion, whether in robots or animals. The SLIP template, which is nothing more than a mass on a spring (a simple pogo stick), has not only accurately modeled the most successful running robots built to date, but also has proven a good descriptive model for the center of mass trajectories for runners as diverse as humans, horses, cockroaches and crabs. The conceptual simplicity of this model, however, hides its analytical complexity. Until now, one consequence of this complexity has been the absence of an appropriate plant model. In this work the "appropriate" plant is not found in the SLIP's continuous dynamics, but rather a discrete manifestation of those dynamics. Unfortunately, the development of such a plant model is hindered by the non-integrability of the SLIP stance dynamics. This has prevented the SLIP template from being leveraged to greater advantage in both robotics and biomechanics research. The work presented in this dissertation provides a means to remove some of the analytical difficulties encountered in the pursuit of a SLIP plant model. In particular, novel approximation strategies that rely on an extension of the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals and Picard-style iterates are used to "integrate" the stance dynamics, resulting in a set of plant models, the iterates, which grow in both accuracy and complexity in a controlled manner. An initial application of a plant model generated in this manner is the identification of SLIP spring laws in human running. The accuracy of the fits obtained in the initial study presented in this dissertation suggest that the SLIP template is more than just a useful metaphor for human running-it may be a literal control target.},

abstract = {The work done during each step to lift and to reaccelerate (in the forward direction) and center of mass has been measured during locomotion in bipeds (rhea and turkey), quadrupeds (dogs, stump-tailed macaques, and ram), and hoppers (kangaroo and springhare). Walking, in all animals (as in man), involves an alternate transfer between gravitational-potential energy and kinetic energy within each stride (as takes place in a pendulum). This transfer is greatest at intermediate walking speeds and can account for up to 70{\%} of the total energy changes taking place within a stride, leaving only 30{\%} to be supplied by muscles. No kinetic-gravitational energy transfer takes place during running, hopping, and trotting, but energy is conserved by another mechanism: an elastic “bounce” of the body. Galloping animals utilize a combination of these two energy-conserving mechanisms. During running, trotting, hopping, and galloping, 1) the power per unit weight required to maintain the forward speed of the center of mass is almost the same in all the species studied; 2) the power per unit weight required to lift the center of mass is almost independent of speed; and 3) the sum of these two powers is almost a linear function of speed.},

abstract = {—The spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model describes well the steady-state center-of-mass motions of a diverse range of walking and running animals and robots. Here we ask whether the SLIP model can also explain the dynamic stability of these gaits, and we find that it cannot do so in many physically-relevant parameter ranges. We develop an actuated, lossy, clock-torqued SLIP, or CT-SLIP, with more realistic hip-motor torque inputs, that can capture the robust stability properties observed in most animals and some legged robots. Variations of CT-SLIP at a similar level of detail and complexity may also be appropriate for capturing the whole-system center-of-mass dynamics of locomotion of legged animals and robots varying widely in size and morphology. This paper contributes to a broader program to develop mathematical models, at varied levels of detail, that capture the dynamics of integrated organismal systems exhibiting integrated whole-body motion. 1. SIMPLE MODELS FOR COMPLICATED SYSTEMS Many legged animals and robots move in a manner resembling a monopod bouncing along: mea-surements taken during steady locomotion from species varying widely in morphology and size reveal net center of mass (CoM) forces and trajectories remarkably similar to those of a pogo-stick, or more precisely, a point-mass atop a passively-sprung massless leg [1–3]: see Fig. 1. This is referred to as the spring-mass model of locomotion, or more formally as the spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP). This paper describes a simple extension and improvement of the SLIP, inspired by the legged robot RHex [4, 5], and generalizable to a wide range of systems. Our basic premise is that low-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), describing classical point mass and rigid body dynamics subject to suitable forcing or activation, can account for dominant effects in complex elec-tromechanical and biological systems. Such models or templates, in the terminology of [6], have been successfully used to reproduce and explain the dynamics of running animals [7–9], and they allow the analytical and computational methods of dynamical systems and stability and bifurcation theory to be applied to such phenomena. For further background, including an extensive review of related work on legged locomotion and 'bio-inspired' robot design, see [10]. Also, see [11] and the issue in which it is found [12], for an overview of locomotion, modeling, and some implications for robotics research. In this introductory section we review the simple spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model, pointing out its advantages and deficiencies, and lay out our strategy. The rest of the paper concerns extensions of the SLIP that address specific properties of the robot. Section 2 describes the clock-torqued CT-SLIP model and its equations of motion, and model results are developed for a specific},

abstract = {The work done at each step during level walking and running to lift the centre of mass of the body, Wv, and to increase its forward speed, Wf, and the total mechanical energy involved (potential + kinetic) Wext, have been measured at various 'constant' speeds (2-32 km/hr) with the technique described by Cavagna (1975). 2. At intermediate speeds of walking (about 4 km/hr) Wv = Wf and Wext/km is at a minimum, as is the energy cost. At lower speeds Wv greater than Wf whereas at higher speeds Wf greather than Wv: in both cases Wext/km increases. 3. The recovery of mechanical energy, through the pendular motion characteristic of walking, was measured as (/Wv/ + /Wf/ - Wext)/(/Wv/ + /Wf/): it attains a maximum (about 65{\%}) at intermediate speeds. 4. A simple model, assuming that in walking the body rotates as an inverted pendulum over the foot in contact with the ground, fits the experimental data better at intermediate speeds but is no longer tenable above 7 km/hr. 5. In running the recovery defined above is minimal (0-4{\%} independent of speed), i.e. Wext congruent to /Wv/ + /Wf/: potential and kinetic energy of the body do not interchange but are simultaneously taken up and released by the muscles with a rate increasing markedly with the speed (from about 1 to 4 h.p.). 6. Wext increases linearly with the running speed Vf from a positive y intercept owing to the fact that Wv is practically constant independent of Vf. On the contrary, Wf = aVf2/(1 + bVf), where b is the ratio between the time spent in the air and the forward distance covered while on the ground during each step.},

If biological inspiration can be used to build robots that deal robustly with complex environments, it should be possible to demonstrate that legged biorobots can function in natural environments. Firstly, we tried to report on theoretic work with a six legged robot designed to emulate spider behavior like walking, running and bounding. We demonstrated theoretically that it can successfully walk, run and bound like a spider over natural terrain. Secondly, limitations in its capability were evaluated, and many biologically based important improvements were obtained for future experimental work. Thirdly, the hexapod robot with bounding gait was controlled by proportional-derivative control algorithm and was carried out by using spring loaded inverted pendulum model. Consequently, the developed kinematic and dynamic methods, and control action method makes both the system control easy and the system performance is improved by decreasing the run time for each loop. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {While the dynamics of running arthropods have been modeled as a spring-mass system, no such structures have been discovered that store and return energy during bouncing. The hindleg of the cockroach Blaberus discoidalis is a good candidate for a passive, vertical leg spring because its vertically oriented joint axes of rotation limit the possibility of active movements and contributions of muscle properties. We oscillated passive legs while measuring force to determine the leg's dynamic, mechanical properties. The relative dimensionless stiffness of an individual cockroach leg was equal to that estimated for a single leg of a biped or quadruped. Leg resilience ranged from 60 to 75{\%}, affording the possibility that the leg could function as a spring to store and return the mechanical energy required to lift and accelerate the center of mass. Because hysteresis was independent of oscillation frequency, we rejected the use of a Voigt model - a simple spring in parallel with a viscous damper. A hysteretic damping model fit the cockroach leg force-displacement data over a wide range of frequencies and displacement using just two parameters. Rather than simply acting as a spring to minimize energy, we hypothesize that legs must manage both energy storage and absorption for rapid running to be most effective.},

abstract = {Locomotion results from complex, high-dimensional, non-linear, dynamically coupled interactions between an organism and its environment. Fortunately, simple models we call templates have been and can be made to resolve the redundancy of multiple legs, joints and muscles by seeking synergies and symmetries. A template is the simplest model (least number of variables and parameters) that exhibits a targeted behavior. For example, diverse species that differ in skeletal type, leg number and posture run in a stable manner like sagittal- and horizontal-plane spring-mass systems. Templates suggest control strategies that can be tested against empirical data. Templates must be grounded in more detailed morphological and physiological models to ask specific questions about multiple legs, the joint torques that actuate them, the recruitment of muscles that produce those torques and the neural networks that activate the ensemble. We term these more elaborate models anchors. They introduce representations of specific biological details whose mechanism of coordination is of interest. Since mechanisms require controls, anchors incorporate specific hypotheses concerning the manner in which unnecessary motion or energy from legs, joints and muscles is removed, leaving behind the behavior of the body in the low-degree-of-freedom template. Locating the origin of control is a challenge because neural and mechanical systems are dynamically coupled and both play a role. The control of slow, variable-frequency locomotion appears to be dominated by the nervous system, whereas during rapid, rhythmic locomotion, the control may reside more within the mechanical system. Anchored templates of many-legged, sprawled-postured animals suggest that passive, dynamic self-stabilization from a feedforward, tuned mechanical system can reject rapid perturbations and simplify control. Future progress would benefit from the creation of a field embracing comparative neuromechanics.},

abstract = {A simple spring-mass model consisting of a massless spring attached to a point mass describes the interdependency of mechanical parameters characterizing running and hopping of humans as a function of speed. The bouncing mechanism itself results in a confinement of the free parameter space where solutions can be found. In particular, bouncing frequency and vertical displacement are closely related. Only a few parameters, such as the vector of the specific landing velocity and the specific leg length, are sufficient to determine the point of operation of the system. There are more physiological constraints than independent parameters. As constraints limit the parameter space where hopping is possible, they must be tuned to each other in order to allow for hopping at all. Within the range of physiologically possible hopping frequencies, a human hopper selects a frequency where the largest amount of energy can be delivered and still be stored elastically. During running and hopping animals use flat angles of the landing velocity resulting in maximum contact length. In this situation ground reaction force is proportional to specific contact time and total displacement is proportional to the square of the step duration. Contact time and hopping frequency are not simply determined by the natural frequency of the spring-mass system, but are influenced largely by the vector of the landing velocity. Differences in the aerial phase or in the angle of the landing velocity result in the different kinematic and dynamic patterns observed during running and hopping. Despite these differences, the model predicts the mass specific energy fluctuations of the center of mass per distance to be similar for runners and hoppers and similar to empirical data obtained for animals of various size. ?? 1989.},

Some of these adhesion systems are mediated by liquid secretion (capillary force), whereas some are purely operated by direct interlocking of high-density microfibers or contact of mushroom-like hairy structures (van der Waals force). In this review, we present an overview of recent advances in beetle-inspired, artificial dry and wet adhesives in the context of nanofabrication and material properties. For convenience, the beetle's adhesions from wing to tiptoe are classified into four types: hair interlocking, mushroom-shaped pads, oil-assisted spatula-shaped pads, and claws. After introducing the structural features and functions of these systems, we describe how the current nanofabrication methods can be applied to mimic or exploit the systems. Furthermore, relevant beetle-inspired structural materials, devices (fastener, medical tape, electric connector, etc.) and microrobots are briefly overviewed, which would shed light on future smart, directional and reversible adhesion systems. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In order to better understand the strategies of locomotion in small insects, we have studied continuous level locomotion of the wood ant species Formica polyctena. We determined the three-dimensional centre of mass kinematics during the gait cycle and recorded the ground reaction forces of single legs utilising a self-developed test site. Our findings show that the animals used the same gait dynamics across a wide speed range without dissolving the tripodal stride pattern. To achieve higher velocities, the ants proportionally increased stride length and stepping frequency. The centre of mass energetics indicated a bouncing gait, in which horizontal kinetic and gravitational potential energy fluctuated in close phase. We determined a high degree of compliance especially in the front legs, as the effective leg length was nearly halved during the contact phase. This leads to only small vertical oscillations of the body, which are important in maintaining ground contact. Bouncing gaits without aerial phases seem to be a common strategy in small runners and can be sufficiently described by the bipedal spring-loaded inverted pendulum model. Thus, with our results, we provide evidence that wood ants perform 'grounded running'.},

abstract = {The biomechanics of running in small animals have remained poorly characterized because of the difficulty of recording three-dimensional ground reaction forces. Available techniques limit investigations to animals with a body mass above 1 g. Here we present, for the first time, single-leg ground reaction forces of ants (body mass 10 mg), measured with a custom-built miniature force plate. We investigated forces and high-speed kinematics for straight level runs (average speed: 8.4 cm s(-1)) of Formica polyctena workers. The major finding was that the time course of ground reaction forces strongly differed from previous observations of larger insects. Maximum vertical force was reached during the first third of the tripod contact phase. During this period the body was decelerated predominantly by the front legs. Subsequently, the front legs pulled and accelerated the body. This 'climbing' type of stride may be useful on the bumpy and unstable substrates that the animals face in their natural habitats, and may therefore also occur on level ground. Propulsive forces were generated predominantly by the front and hind legs. Dragging of the gaster on the substrate resulted in a breaking momentum, which was compensated by the legs. Future investigations will reveal, whether the identified pattern is due to specialization.},

@article{Labonte2014,
abstract = {Many stick insects and mantophasmids possess tarsal 'heel pads' (euplantulae) covered by arrays of conical, micrometre-sized hairs (acanthae). These pads are used mainly under compression; they respond to load with increasing shear resistance, and show negligible adhesion. Reflected-light microscopy in stick insects (Carausius morosus) revealed that the contact area of 'heel pads' changes with normal load on three hierarchical levels. First, loading brought larger areas of the convex pads into contact. Second, loading increased the density of acanthae in contact. Third, higher loads changed the shape of individual hair contacts gradually from circular (tip contact) to elongated (side contact). The resulting increase in real contact area can explain the load dependence of friction, indicating a constant shear stress between acanthae and substrate. As the euplantula contact area is negligible for small loads (similar to hard materials), but increases sharply with load (resembling soft materials), these pads show high friction coefficients despite little adhesion. This property appears essential for the pads' use in locomotion. Several morphological characteristics of hairy friction pads are in apparent contrast to hairy pads used for adhesion, highlighting key adaptations for both pad types. Our results are relevant for the design of fibrillar structures with high friction coefficients but small adhesion.},

abstract = {? 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.We study the detailed locomotor mechanics of a small, lightweight robot (DynaRoACH, 10 cm, 25 g) which can move on a granular substrate of closely packed 3 mm diameter glass particles at speeds up to 50 cm/s (5 body length/s), approaching the performance of small, highperforming, desert-dwelling lizards. To reveal how the robot achieves this high performance, we use high speed imaging to capture kinematics, and develop a numerical multi-body simulation of the robot coupled to an experimentally validated discrete element method (DEM) simulation of the granular media. Average forward speeds measured in both experiment and simulation agreed well, and increased non-linearly with stride frequency, reflecting a change in the mode of propulsion. At low frequencies, the robot used a quasi-static "rotary walking" mode, in which the granular material yielded as the legs penetrated and then solidified once vertical force balance was achieved. At high frequencies, duty factor decreased below 0.5 and aerial phases occurred. The propulsion mechanism was qualitatively different: the robot ran rapidly by utilizing the speed-dependent fluid-like inertial response of the material. We also used our simulation tool to vary substrate parameters that were inconvenient to vary in experiment (e.g., granular particle friction) to test performance and reveal limits of stability of the robot. Using small robots as physical models, our study reveals a mechanism by which small animals can achieve high performance on granular substrates, which in return advances the design and control of small robots in deformable terrains.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the design and analysis of underactu-ated robotic hands that use tendons and compliant joints to en-able passive mechanical adaptation during grasping tasks. We use a quasistatic equilibrium formulation to predict the stability of a given grasp. This method is then used as the inner loop of an optimization algorithm that can find a set of actuation mecha-nism parameters that optimize the stability measure for an entire set of grasps. We discuss two possible approaches to design opti-mization using this framework, one using exhaustive search over the parameter space, and the other using a simplified gripper construction to cast the problem to a form that is directly solv-able using well-established optimization methods. Computations are performed in 3D, allow arbitrary geometry of the grasped objects and take into account frictional constraints. INTRODUCTION In this study 1 , we present a framework for the analysis and optimization of a class of passively adaptive underactuated robotic hands. In a broad sense, this is the task of replacing elaborate run-time algorithms (often requiring extensive sensor arrays for input and complex actuation mechanisms for execu-tion) with off-line analysis, performed before the hand is even built. We focus on highly underactuated hand models, where the number of joints far exceeds the number of actuators, noting for example that recent studies have shown reliable grasping perfor-mance with even a single actuator for multiple fingers and up to Individual parts of this work have been published in conference proceedings in [1, 2].

abstract = {The joint coupling necessary to allow for underactuation is often accomplished through compliance in the manipulator structure. Compliance is perhaps the simplest way to allow for coupling between joints without enforcing the fixed-motion coupling relationship inherent with gear or linkage couplings. Compliant couplings are a simple way to allow a joint to passively deflect without causing a fixed-motion proportional change in the joints to which it is coupled. ABSTRACT This paper examines the nature of joint coupling in underactuated grippers for environments where object properties and location may not be well known. A grasper consisting of a pair of two-link planar fingers with compliant revolute joints was simulated as it was actuated after contact with a target object. The joint coupling configuration of the gripper was varied in order to maximize successful grasp range and minimize contact forces for a wide range of target object size and position. A normal distribution of object position was assumed in order to model sensing uncertainty and weight the results accordingly. The results show that proximal-distal joint torque ratios of around 0.6 produced the best results for cases in which sensory information available for the task was poor, and ratios of around 1.0 produced the best results for cases in which sensory information available for the task was good. Compliant underactuated grippers show particular promise for use in unstructured environments, where object properties are not known a priori and sensing is prone to error. Finger compliance allows the gripper to passively conform to a wide range of objects while minimizing contact forces. Passive compliance offers additional benefits, particularly in impacts, where control loop delays may lead to poor control of contact forces [1,2]. Compliance can also lower implementation costs by reducing the sensing and actuation required for the gripper. In previous work, we examined the optimization of the preshape and joint stiffness of simple two-fingered grippers with passive springs in the joints. This study showed that for a particular set of joint stiffnesses and rest angles, the widest range of range of uncertainty in object size and location could be allowed for. Contact forces were also minimized at approximately the same gripper configuration. In addition to simulation studies, these results were confirmed with experimental tests using a reconfigurable gripper [3].},

Although underactuated hands are generally not con-sidered to be adept at dexterous tasks, we have found through past work that an underac-tuated manipulator can control n degrees of freedom with n actuators by leveraging the passive compliance to satisfy contact constraints on the object. Assuming the system to be quasi-static, the workspace of the underactuated mechanism is found through constraint-based energy minimization by sweeping through the set of allowable inputs. In this study, we investigate achievable workspaces by exploring the nondimensionalized design space, consisting of linkage ratio, joint stiffness ratio, transmission ratio, base linkage length, and object linkage length. The results of this study are useful in motivating the design of dexterous, underactuated manipulators, as well as to predict the achievable workspace of specific hand/object configurations.},

Progress was very slow for the next 50 years and then, about 1885, a mild interest developed with the discovery of point contact rectifiers. These devices were used as detectors until displaced by the vacuum tube around 1915. Development of selenium and cuprous oxide rectifiers about 1930 revived interest and the publication of a good theory of semiconductors in 1931 added still more momentum. The next period of active interest came around World War II when the catwhisker diode was revived and developed into an excellent radar detector. The announcement of the transistor in 1948 gave this field of research such a boost that it has become a real giant in the last few years and semiconductor electronics now rates as a major field of endeavor.},

The main issues of artificial tactile sensing are addressed. General requirements of a tactile sensor are briefly discussed and the main transduction technologies are analyzed. Twenty eight various tactile sensors, each integrated into a robot hand, are classified in accordance with their transduction types and applications. Previously issued reviews are focused on hardware part of tactile sensors, whereas we present an overview of algorithms and tactile feedback-based control systems that exploit signals from the sensors. The applications of these algorithms include grasp stability estimation, tactile object recognition, tactile servoing and force control.

The result replaces the direct computation of information gradients by a sensor coverage criterion, which can greatly reduce computation.

@article{Fujihira2016,
abstract = {—In this study, we focused on sheet manipulation with robotic hands. This manipulation involves grasping the sides of the sheet and utilizing the convex area resulting from bending the sheet. This sheet manipulation requires the development of a model of a bent sheet grasped with fingertips. We investigated the relationship between the grasping force and bending of the sheet and developed a bent sheet model. We also performed exper-iments on the sheet grasping stability with a focus on the resistible force, which is defined as the maximum external force at which a fingertip can maintain contact when applying an external force. The main findings and contributions are as follows. 1) After the sheet buckles, the grasping force only increases slightly even if the fingertip pressure is increased. 2) The range of the appli-cable grasping forces depends on the stiffness of the fingertips. Stiffer fingertips cannot provide a small grasping force but can resist large external forces. Softer fingertips can provide a small grasping force but cannot resist large external forces. 3) A grasp-ing strategy for sheet manipulation is presented that is based on controlling the stiffness of the fingertips.},

abstract = {This paper applies dimensional synthesis to explore the geometric design of dexterous three-fingered robotic hands for maximizing precision manipulation workspace, in which the hand stably moves an object with respect to the palm of the hand, with contacts only on the fingertips. We focus primarily on the tripod grasp, which is the most commonly used grasp for precision manipulation. We systematically explore the space of design parameters, with two main objectives: maximize the workspace of a fully actuated hand and explore how under-actuation modifies it. We use a mathematical framework that models the hand-plus-object system and examine how the workspace varies with changes in nine hand and object parameters such as link length and finger arrangement on the palm.Results show that to achieve the largest workspaces the palm radius should be approximately half of a finger length larger than the target object radius, that the distal link of the two-link fingers should be around 1–1.2 times the length of the proximal link, and that fingers should be arranged symmetrically about the palm with object contacts also symmetric. Furthermore, a proper parameter design for an under-actuated hand can achieve up to 50{\%} of the workspace of a fully actuated hand. When compared to the system parameters of existing popular hand designs, larger palms and longer distal links are needed to maximize the manipulation workspace of the studied design.},

abstract = {This paper examines joint coupling in underactuated robotic grippers for unstructured environments where object properties and location may not be well known. A simplified grasper consisting of a pair of two-link planar fingers with compliant revolute joints was simulated as it grasped a target object. The joint coupling configuration of the gripper was varied in order to maximize successful grasp range and minimize contact forces for a wide range of target object sizes and positions. The number of actuators was also varied in order to test performance for varying degrees of underactuation. A normal distribution of object position was used to model sensing uncertainty and weight the results accordingly. There are three main results: distal/proximal joint torque ratios of around 1.0 produced the best results, both for cases in which sensory information available for the task was poor and when sensing was good; an actuator for each gripper finger performs no better than a single actuator for both fingers; and that for good sensing, the gripper should be positioned off-center from the object, resulting in an increased lever arm and lower unbalanced contact forces on the object.},

abstract = {3-D printing is an emerging technology that has been used primarily on small scales for rapid prototyping, but which could also herald a wider movement towards decentralized, highly customizable manufacturing. Polymers are the most common materials to be 3-D printed today, but there is great demand for a way to easily print metals. Existing techniques for 3-D printing metals tend to be expensive and energy-intensive, and usually require high temperatures or pressures, making them incompatible with polymers, organics, soft materials, and biological materials. Here, we describe room temperature liquid metals as complements to polymers for 3-D printing applications. These metals enable the fabrication of soft, flexible, and stretchable devices. We survey potential room temperature liquid metal candidates and describe the benefits of gallium and its alloys for these purposes. We demonstrate the direct printing of a liquid gallium alloy in both 2-D and 3-D and highlight the structures and shapes that can be fabricated using these processes. {\textcopyright} 2014 SPIE.},

A type of piezoceramic composite actuator known as Macro-Fiber Composite (MFC) is used for changing the camber of all control surfaces on the aircraft. The aircraft is analyzed theoretically for its two- and three- dimensional aerodynamic characteristics to aid the design of the piezoelectric control surfaces. A vortex-lattice analysis complemented the database of aerodynamic derivatives used to analyze control response. Steady state roll rates are measured in a wind tunnel and compared to a similar aircraft with servomotor actuated control surfaces. The theoretical analysis and wind tunnel testing demonstrated the stability and control authority of the concept, culminating in a landmark first flight of the completely MFC controlled aircraft on April 29, 2010. An electric motor driven propulsion system is used to generate thrust and all systems (including the high voltage converters) are powered with a single Lithium-Polymer battery. This vehicle became the first completely MFC controlled, flight tested aircraft. It is also known to be the first fully solid-state piezoelectric material controlled, non-tethered, flight tested fixed-wing aircraft.},

However, key challenges in the design and manufacture of soft robots include the complex fabrication processes and the interfacing of soft and rigid components.We used multimaterial three-dimensional (3D) printing to manufacture a combustion-powered robot whose body transitions from a rigid core to a soft exterior.

The sensor is made of a hyperelastic silicone elastomer that contains embedded microchannels filled with conductive liquids. This is an effort of improving the previously reported soft sensors that uses a single liquid conductor. The proposed sensor employs a hybrid approach involving two liquid conductors: an ionic solution and an eutectic gallium-indium alloy. This hybrid method reduces the sensitivity to noise that may be caused by variations in electrical resistance of the wire interface and undesired stress applied to signal routing areas. The bridge between these two liquids is made conductive by doping the elastomer locally with nickel nanoparticles. The design, fabrication, and characterization of the sensor are presented.},

However, restricted to the rather limited conductive inks and available printing strategies, the current electronics manufacture is usually confined to industry level. Here, we show a highly cost-effective and entirely automatic printing way towards personal electronics making, through introducing a tapping-mode composite fluid delivery system. Fundamental mechanisms regarding the reliable printing, transfer and adhesion of the liquid metal inks on the substrate were disclosed through systematic theoretical interpretation and experimental measurements. With this liquid metal printer, a series of representative electronic patterns spanning from single wires to desired complex configurations such as integrated circuit (IC), printed-circuits-on-board (PCB), electronic paintings, or more do-it-yourself (DIY) devices, were demonstrated to be printed out with high precision in a moment. And the total machine cost already reached personally affordable price. This is hard to achieve by a conventional PCB technology which generally takes long time and is material, water and energy consuming, while the existing printed electronics is still far away from the real direct printing goal. The present work opens the way for large scale personal electronics manufacture and is expected to generate important value for the coming society.},

It reviews the general formulation, terminology, and typical experimental implementations of reinforcement learning as well as competing solution paradigms. In order to compare the relative merits of various techniques, it presents a case study of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with unknown dynamics, perhaps the simplest and best-studied problem in optimal control. It also describes how merging techniques from learning theory and control can provide nonasymptotic characterizations of LQR performance and shows that these characterizations tend to match experimental behavior. In turn, when revisiting more complex applications, many of the observed phenomena in LQR persist. In particular, theory and experiment demonstrate the role and importance of models and the cost of generality in reinforcement learning algorithms. The article concludes with a discussion of some of the challenges in designing learning systems that safely and reliably interact with complex and uncertain environments and how tools from reinforcement learning and control might be combined to approach these challenges.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. This paper addresses the problem of finding robot configurations to grasp assembly parts during a sequence of collaborative assembly operations. We formulate the search for such configurations as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). Collision constraints in an operation and transfer constraints between operations determine the sets of feasible robot configurations. We show that solving the connected constraint graph with off-the-shelf CSP algorithms can quickly become infeasible even for a few sequential assembly operations. We present an algorithm which, through the assumption of feasible regrasps, divides the CSP into independent smaller problems that can be solved exponentially faster. The algorithm then uses local search techniques to improve this solution by removing a gradually increasing number of regrasps from the plan. The algorithm enables the user to stop the planner anytime and use the current best plan if the cost of removing regrasps from the plan exceeds the cost of executing those regrasps. We present simulation experiments to compare our algorithm's performance to a naive algorithm which directly solves the connected constraint graph. We also present a real robot system which uses the output of our planner to grasp and bring parts together in assembly configurations.},

Motivated by recent empirical success of RL on continuous control tasks, we study the sample complexity of popular model-based and model-free algorithms on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). We show that for policy evaluation, a simple model-based plugin method requires asymptotically less samples than the classical least-squares temporal difference (LSTD) estimator to reach the same quality of solution; the sample complexity gap between the two methods can be at least a factor of state dimension. For policy evaluation, we study a simple family of problem instances and show that nominal (certainty equivalence principle) control also requires several factors of state and input dimension fewer samples than the policy gradient method to reach the same level of control performance on these instances. Furthermore, the gap persists even when employing commonly used baselines.

In past work, this compiler was limited to a non-optimized search approach which scaled poorly with the structure size. Here, we recast the process as a constraint satisfaction problem and present new scalable compiler schemes and the ability to quickly generate provably correct maps (or find that none exist) of structures with up to 1 million bricks. We compare the performance of the compilers on a range of structures, and show how the structure completion time is related to the inter-dependencies between built locations. We then show how the transition probability between locations in the structure affect assembly time, and may be optimized to drastically improve system efficiency.

This self-reconfiguration process is difficult to control, because it involves the distributed coordination of large numbers of identical modules connected in time-varying ways. We present an approach where a desired shape is grown based on a scalable representation of the desired configuration, which is automatically generated from a 3D CAD model. The size of the configuration is adjusted continually to match the number of modules in the system. This has the advantage that if modules are removed or added, the system automatically adjusts its scale and thus self-repair is obtained as a side effect. This capability is achieved by distributed, local rules for module movement that are independent of the goal configuration. We compare the scale independent approach to one where the desired configuration is grown directly at a fixed scale. We find that the features of the scale independent approach come at the expense of an increased number of moves, messages, and time steps taken to reconfigure.},

On the other hand, by defining new state variables based on the integral and differential of position and orientation errors of the grasped object, the error system of coordinated robot manipulators is constructed. Subsequently by defining the appropriate change of coordinates and using the backstepping design strategy, an adaptive fuzzy backstepping position tracking control scheme is proposed for multi-robot manipulator systems. By utilizing the properties of internal forces, extra terms are also added to the control signals to consider the force tracking problem. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed adaptive fuzzy backstepping position/force control approach ensures all the signals of the closed loop system uniformly ultimately bounded and tracking errors of both positions and forces can converge to small desired values by proper selection of the design parameters. Finally, the theoretic achievements are tested on the two three-link planar robot manipulators cooperatively handling a common object to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {In this paper, application of an adaptive control scheme to a cooperating robotic system consisting of two 5 DOF (RRRRR) robot manipulators is proposed. The considered dual system is used to manipulate a rigid payload on a desired trajectory between two desired initial and end positions/orientations. The forward and inverse kinematics problems are solved for the dual arm system. The dynamic equations of motion for two arms and the payload are derived and the constraints are utilized to obtain the combined required equations. The control method needs measurements of position, velocity and acceleration of the object and doesn't need the measurements of forces and moments at the contact points. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the performance of the control algorithm. The robustness of the proposed control scheme is verified in the presence of disturbance and uncertainty.},

@article{Karpenko2007a,
abstract = {In this paper, reinforcement learning is applied to coordinate, in a decentralized fashion, the motions of a pair of hydraulic actuators whose task is to firmly hold and move an object along a specified trajectory under conventional position control. The learning goal is to reduce the interaction forces acting on the object that arise due to inevitable positioning errors resulting from the imperfect closed-loop actuator dynamics. Each actuator is therefore outfitted with a reinforcement learning neural network that modifies a centrally planned formation constrained position trajectory in response to the locally measured interaction force. It is shown that the actuators, which form a multiagent learning system, can learn decentralized control strategies that reduce the object interaction forces and thus greatly improve their coordination on the manipulation task. However, the problem of credit assignment, a common difficulty in multiagent learning systems, prevents the actuators from learning control strategies where each actuator contributes equally to reducing the interaction force. This problem is resolved in this paper via the periodic communication of limited local state information between the reinforcement learning actuators. Using both simulations and experiments, this paper examines some of the issues pertaining to learning in dynamic multiagent environments and establishes reinforcement learning as a potential technique for coordinating several nonlinear hydraulic manipulators performing a common task.},

Adaptive control algorithm ensures a parameter adaptation law satisfying the stability condition of uncertain systems. In designing robust control structure, contact and friction constraints for grasp and bearing conditions, structural flexibility or such similar factors as various unmodeled dynamics are considered as the uncertainties that determine the available values of control parameters. The novelty of results in the present paper is to define new control inputs using the parametric uncertainties and the Lyapunov-based theory of guaranteed stability of uncertain systems. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The impedance control of dual-arm 7-DOF cooperative manipulators is considered in this paper. Global compliant behavior for the whole system is achieved using impedance at three levels, i.e. object, end-effector and body level. A centralized impedance control strategy is provided to confer a compliant behavior to the object, while an active decentralized impedance control with force tracking is enforced to the end-effectors to control the internal forces on the object. A compliant behavior for the body of the dual-arm system is obtained by means of null-space impedance control. The manipulability measure of the whole system is locally maximized within this algorithm. The developed control scheme is verified in a simulation environment composed of two cooperating 7-DOF KUKA lightweight arms carrying a common object. {\textcopyright} 2012 IFAC.},
