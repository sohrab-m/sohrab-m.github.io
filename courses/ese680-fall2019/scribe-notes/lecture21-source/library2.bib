abstract = {In this paper, the position and force tracking control problem of cooperative robot manipulator system handling a common rigid object with unknown dynamical models and unknown external disturbances is investigated. The universal approximation properties of fuzzy logic systems are employed to estimate the unknown system dynamics. On the other hand, by defining new state variables based on the integral and differential of position and orientation errors of the grasped object, the error system of coordinated robot manipulators is constructed. Subsequently by defining the appropriate change of coordinates and using the backstepping design strategy, an adaptive fuzzy backstepping position tracking control scheme is proposed for multi-robot manipulator systems. By utilizing the properties of internal forces, extra terms are also added to the control signals to consider the force tracking problem. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed adaptive fuzzy backstepping position/force control approach ensures all the signals of the closed loop system uniformly ultimately bounded and tracking errors of both positions and forces can converge to small desired values by proper selection of the design parameters. Finally, the theoretic achievements are tested on the two three-link planar robot manipulators cooperatively handling a common object to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the optimal control problem known as the Linear Quadratic Regulator in the case when the dynamics are unknown. We propose a multi-stage procedure, called Coarse-ID control, that estimates a model from a few experimental trials, estimates the error in that model with respect to the truth, and then designs a controller using both the model and uncertainty estimate. Our technique uses contemporary tools from random matrix theory to bound the error in the estimation procedure. We also employ a recently developed approach to control synthesis called System Level Synthesis that enables robust control design by solving a convex optimization problem. We provide end-to-end bounds on the relative error in control cost that are nearly optimal in the number of parameters and that highlight salient properties of the system to be controlled such as closed-loop sensitivity and optimal control magnitude. We show experimentally that the Coarse-ID approach enables efficient computation of a stabilizing controller in regimes where simple control schemes that do not take the model uncertainty into account fail to stabilize the true system.},

Based on a subspace identification algorithm and a finite number of {\$}N{\$} output samples, we provide non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for the system parameter estimation errors. Our analysis uses recent results from random matrix theory, self-normalized martingales and SVD robustness, in order to show that with high probability the estimation errors decrease with a rate of {\$}1/\backslashsqrt{\{}N{\}}{\$}.

On the other hand, the most popular system identification methods assume that all uncertainty is in the form of additive noise. This has hampered the application of robust control methods to practical problems. This paper begins to address the gap between the models used in control synthesis and those obtained from identification experi- ments by considering the connection between uncertain models and data. The model validation problem addressed here is: given experimental data and a model with both additive noise and norm-bounded perturbations, is it possible that the model could produce the observed input-output data? This problem is stud- ied for the standard H,/p framework models. A necessary condition for such a model to describe an experimental datum is obtained. Furthermore, for a large class of models, in the robust control framework, this condition is computable as the solution of a quadratic optimization problem.},

Our lower bounds reveal that these upper bounds match up to logarithmic factors. In particular, we capture the correct signal-to-noise behavior of the problem, showing that more unstable linear systems are easier to estimate. This behavior is qualitatively different from arguments which rely on mixing-time calculations that suggest that unstable systems are more difficult to estimate.

This interest is due to the ability of providing accurate state-space models for multivariable linear systems directly from input-output data. The methods have their origin in classical state-space realization theory as developed in the 1960s. The main computational tools are the QR and the singular-value decompositions. Here, an overview of existing subspace-based techniques for system identification is given. The methods are grouped into the classes of realization-based and direct techniques. Similarities between different algorithms are pointed out, and their applicability is commented upon. We also discuss some recent ideas for improving and extending the methods. A simulation example is included for comparing different algorithms. The subspace-based approach is found to perform competitive with respect to prediction-error methods, provided the system is properly excited. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Physical contact events often allow a natural decomposition of manipulation tasks into action phases and subgoals. Within the motion primitive paradigm, each action phase corresponds to a motion primitive, and the subgoals correspond to the goal parameters of these primitives. Current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms are able to efficiently and robustly optimize the parameters of motion primitives in very high-dimensional problems. These algorithms often consider only shape parameters, which determine the trajectory between the start- and end-point of the movement. In manipulation, however, it is also crucial to optimize the goal parameters, which represent the subgoals between the motion primitives. We therefore extend the policy improvement with path integrals (PI2) algorithm to simultaneously optimize shape and goal parameters. Applying simultaneous shape and goal learning to sequences of motion primitives leads to the novel algorithm PI2 Seq. We use our methods to address a fundamental challenge in manipulation: improving the robustness of everyday pick-and-place tasks. {\textcopyright} 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Robust control theory studies the effect of noise, disturbances, and other uncertainty on system performance. Despite growing recognition across science and engineering that robustness and efficiency tradeoffs dominate the evolution and design of complex systems, the use of robust control theory remains limited, partly because the mathematics involved is relatively inaccessible to nonexperts, and the important concepts have been inexplicable without a fairly rich mathematics background. This paper aims to begin changing that by presenting the most essential concepts in robust control using human stick balancing, a simple case study popular in both the sensorimotor control literature and extremely familiar to engineers. With minimal and familiar models and mathematics, we can explore the impact of unstable poles and zeros, delays, and noise, which can then be easily verified with simple experiments using a standard extensible pointer. Despite its simplicity, this case study has extremes of robustness and fragility that are initially counter-intuitive but for which simple mathematics and experiments are clear and compelling. The theory used here has been well-known for many decades, and the cart-pendulum example is a standard in undergrad controls courses, yet a careful reconsidering of both leads to striking new insights that we argue are of great pedagogical value.},

abstract = {In this paper, a method to synthesize controllers using finite time convergence control barrier functions guided by linear temporal logic specifications for continuous time multi-agent dynamical systems is proposed. Finite time convergence to a desired set in the state space is guaranteed under the existence of a suitable finite time convergence control barrier function. In addition, these barrier functions also guarantee forward invariance once the system converges to the desired set. This allows us to formulate a theoretical framework which synthesizes controllers for the multi-agent system. These properties also enable us to solve the reachability problem in continuous time by formulating a theorem on the composition of multiple finite time convergence control barrier functions. This approach is more flexible than existing methods and also allows for a greater set of feasible control laws. Linear temporal logic is used to specify complex task specifications that need to be satisfied by the multi-agent system. With this solution methodology, a control law is synthesized that satisfies the given temporal logic task specification. Robotic experiments are provided which were performed on the Robotarium multi-robot testbed at Georgia Tech.},

According to the literature (Barcia et. at., 1992) the electro-dissolution process leads to the existence of a viscosity gradient in the interface metal-solution, which leads to a velocity field quantitatively different form the one developed in uniform viscosity conditions and may affect the stability of the hydrodynamic field. The purpose of this work is to investigate whether a steady viscosity profile, depending on the distance to the electrode surface, affects the stability properties of the classic velocity field near a rotating disc. Two classes of perturbations are considered: perturbations monotonically varying along the radial direction, and perturbations periodically modulated along the radial direction. The results show that the hydrodynamic field is always stable with respect to the first class of perturbations and that the neutral stability curves are modified by the presence of a viscosity gradient in the second case, in the sense of reducing the critical Reynolds number beyond which perturbations are amplified. This result supports the hypothesis that the current oscillations observed in the polarization curve may originate from a hydrodynamic instability.},

abstract = {A common belief in model-free reinforcement learning is that methods based on random search in the parameter space of policies exhibit significantly worse sample complexity than those that explore the space of actions. We dispel such beliefs by introducing a random search method for training static, linear policies for continuous control problems, matching state-of-the-art sample efficiency on the benchmark MuJoCo locomotion tasks. Our method also finds a nearly optimal controller for a challenging instance of the Linear Quadratic Regulator, a classical problem in control theory, when the dynamics are not known. Computationally, our random search algorithm is at least 15 times more efficient than the fastest competing model-free methods on these benchmarks. We take advantage of this computational efficiency to evaluate the performance of our method over hundreds of random seeds and many different hyperparameter configurations for each benchmark task. Our simulations highlight a high variability in performance in these benchmark tasks, suggesting that commonly used estimations of sample efficiency do not adequately evaluate the performance of RL algorithms.},

@article{Willia1992,
abstract = {This article presents a general class of associative reinforcement learning algorithms for connectionist networks containing stochastic units. These algorithms, called REINFORCE algorithms, are shown to make weight adjustments in a direction that lies along the gradient of expected reinforcement in both immediate-reinforcement tasks and certain limited forms of delayed-reinforcement tasks, and they do this without explicitly computing gradient estimates or even storing information from which such estimates could be computed. Specific examples of such algorithms are presented, some of which bear a close relationship to certain existing algorithms while others are novel but potentially interesting in their own right. Also given are results that show how such algorithms can be naturally integrated with backpropagation. We close with a brief discussion of a number of additional issues surrounding the use of such algorithms, including what is known about their limiting behaviors as well as further considerations that might be used to help develop similar but potentially more powerful reinforcement learning algorithms. {\textcopyright} 1992, Kluwer Academic Publishers.

abstract = {While the dynamics of running arthropods have been modeled as a spring-mass system, no such structures have been discovered that store and return energy during bouncing. The hindleg of the cockroach Blaberus discoidalis is a good candidate for a passive, vertical leg spring because its vertically oriented joint axes of rotation limit the possibility of active movements and contributions of muscle properties. We oscillated passive legs while measuring force to determine the leg's dynamic, mechanical properties. The relative dimensionless stiffness of an individual cockroach leg was equal to that estimated for a single leg of a biped or quadruped. Leg resilience ranged from 60 to 75{\%}, affording the possibility that the leg could function as a spring to store and return the mechanical energy required to lift and accelerate the center of mass. Because hysteresis was independent of oscillation frequency, we rejected the use of a Voigt model - a simple spring in parallel with a viscous damper. A hysteretic damping model fit the cockroach leg force-displacement data over a wide range of frequencies and displacement using just two parameters. Rather than simply acting as a spring to minimize energy, we hypothesize that legs must manage both energy storage and absorption for rapid running to be most effective.},

abstract = {The biomechanics of running in small animals have remained poorly characterized because of the difficulty of recording three-dimensional ground reaction forces. Available techniques limit investigations to animals with a body mass above 1 g. Here we present, for the first time, single-leg ground reaction forces of ants (body mass 10 mg), measured with a custom-built miniature force plate. We investigated forces and high-speed kinematics for straight level runs (average speed: 8.4 cm s(-1)) of Formica polyctena workers. The major finding was that the time course of ground reaction forces strongly differed from previous observations of larger insects. Maximum vertical force was reached during the first third of the tripod contact phase. During this period the body was decelerated predominantly by the front legs. Subsequently, the front legs pulled and accelerated the body. This 'climbing' type of stride may be useful on the bumpy and unstable substrates that the animals face in their natural habitats, and may therefore also occur on level ground. Propulsive forces were generated predominantly by the front and hind legs. Dragging of the gaster on the substrate resulted in a breaking momentum, which was compensated by the legs. Future investigations will reveal, whether the identified pattern is due to specialization.},

In particular, we show how to perform straight-line motion, turning while on obstacles, climbing over tall obstacles, and tunneling under overhangs, all of which work for groups of arbitrary size. This last feature is important, as it also allows a large system of self-reconfiguring modules to divide up into several groups of various sizes, each of which is equally capable of motion and participation in the overall group task. We also discuss implementations and ways to improve efficiency and switching between tasks.},

More specifically, we are interested in using a method that allows the emergence of different species if they are required by the task, that is, if specialization provides an advantage in the completion of the task, without the designer having to predefine the best way to solve it. To this end, in this work we have applied a co-evolutionary algorithm called ASiCo (Asynchronous Situated Co-evolution) which is based on an open-ended evolution of the robots in their environment. In this environment the robots are born, mate and die throughout the generations as in an artificial life system. In order to show that ASiCo is capable of obtaining species automatically if they are advantageous, here we apply it to a collective gathering and construction task where homogeneous teams are suboptimal. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {A Novel Concept for the Study of Heterogeneous Robotic Swarms warm robotics systems are characterized by decentral-ized control, limited commu-nication between robots, use of local information, and emergence of global behavior. Such sys-tems have shown their potential for flexibility and robustness [1]–[3]. However, existing swarm robotics sys-tems are by and large still limited to displaying simple proof-of-concept behaviors under laboratory conditions. It is our contention that one of the fac-tors holding back swarm robotics research is the almost universal insis-tence on homogeneous system compo-nents. We believe that swarm robotics designers must embrace heterogene-ity if they ever want swarm robotics systems to approach the complexity required of real-world systems. To date, swarm robotics systems have almost exclusively comprised physi-cally and behaviorally undifferentiated agents. This design decision has its roots in ethological models of self-organizing natural systems. These models serve as inspiration for swarm robotics system designers, but are often highly abstract simplifications of natural systems and, to date, have largely assumed homogeneous agents. Selected dynamics of the systems under study are shown to emerge from the interactions of identical system components, ignoring the heterogeneities (physical, spatial, functional, and informational) that one can find in almost any natural system. The field of swarm robotics currently lacks methods and tools with which to study and leverage the heterogeneity that is present in natural sys-tems. To remedy this deficiency, we propose swarmanoid, an innovative swarm robotics system composed of three different robot types with com-plementary skills: foot-bots are small autonomous robots specialized in moving on both even and uneven terrains, capable of self-assembling and of transporting objects or other robots; hand-bots are autonomous robots capable of climbing some vertical surfaces and manipulating small objects; and eye-bots are autonomous flying robots that can attach to an indoor ceil-ing, capable of analyzing the environment from a privileged position to},

abstract = {Real-world applications that are ideal for robotic solutions are very
complex and challenging. Many of these applications are set in dynamic environments
that require capabilities distributed in functionality, space, or time.
These applications, therefore, often require teams of robots to work together cooperatively
to successfully address the mission. While much research in recent
years has addressed the issues of autonomous robots and multi-robot cooperation,
current robotics technology is still far from achieving many of these real
world applications. We believe that two primary reasons for this technology
gap are that (1) previous work has not adequately addressed the issues of fault
tolerance and adaptivity in multi-robot teams, and (2) existing robotics research
is often geared at specic applications, and is not easily generalized to
dierent, but related, applications. This paper addresses these issues by rst
describing the design issues of key importance in these real-world cooperative
robotics applications | fault tolerance, reliability, adaptivity, and coherence.
We then present a general architecture addressing these design issues | called
ALLIANCE | that facilitates multi-robot cooperation of small- to mediumsized
teams in dynamic environments, performing missions composed of loosely
coupled subtasks. We illustrate the generality of this architecture by describing
two very dierent proof-of-concept implementations of this architecture: a
janitorial service mission, and a bounding overwatch mission.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Author(s). Licensee InTech. Learning capabilities, often guided by competition/cooperation, play a fundamental and ubiquitous role in living beings. Moreover, several behaviours, such as feeding and courtship, involve environmental exploration and exploitation, including local competition, and lead to a global benefit for the colony. This can be considered as a form of global cooperation, even if the individual agent is not aware of the overall effect. This paper aims to demonstrate that identical biorobots, endowed with simple neural controllers, can evolve diversified behaviours and roles when competing for the same resources in the same arena. These behaviours also produce a benefit in terms of time and energy spent by the whole group. The robots are tasked with a classical foraging task structured through the cyclic activation of resources. The result is that each individual robot, while competing to reach the maximum number of available targets, tends to prefer a specific sequence of subtasks. This indirectly leads to the global result of task partitioning whereby the cumulative energy spent, in terms of the overall travelled distance and the time needed to complete the task, tends to be minimized. A series of simulation experiments is conducted using different numbers of robots and scenarios: the common emergent result obtained is the role-specialization of each robot. The description of the neural controller and the specialization mechanisms are reported in detail and discussed.},

Two cooperating microprocessors control each module's magnetic connection mechanisms and infrared communication interfaces.

abstract = {This paper presents a decentralized control strategy for positioning and orienting multiple robotic cameras to collectively monitor an environment. The cameras may have various degrees of mobility from six degrees of freedom, to one degree of freedom. The control strategy is proven to locally minimize a novel metric representing information loss over the environment. It can accommodate groups of cameras with heterogeneous degrees of mobility (e.g., some that only translate and some that only rotate), and is adaptive to robotic cameras being added or deleted from the group, and to changing environmental conditions. The robotic cameras share information for their controllers over a wireless network using a specially designed multihop networking algorithm. The control strategy is demonstrated in repeated experiments with three flying quadrotor robots indoors, and with five flying quadrotor robots outdoors. Simulation results for more complex scenarios are also presented.},

abstract = {This manuscript describes a unique class of locomotive robot: A soft robot, composed exclusively of soft materials (elastomeric polymers), which is inspired by animals (e.g., squid, starfish, worms) that do not have hard internal skeletons. Soft lithography was used to fabricate a pneumatically actuated robot capable of sophisticated locomotion (e.g., fluid movement of limbs and multiple gaits). This robot is quadrupedal; it uses no sensors, only five actuators, and a simple pneumatic valving system that operates at low pressures ({\textless} 10 psi). A combination of crawling and undulation gaits allowed this robot to navigate a difficult obstacle. This demonstration illustrates an advantage of soft robotics: They are systems in which simple types of actuation produce complex motion.},

abstract = {This paper examines joint coupling in underactuated robotic grippers for unstructured environments where object properties and location may not be well known. A simplified grasper consisting of a pair of two-link planar fingers with compliant revolute joints was simulated as it grasped a target object. The joint coupling configuration of the gripper was varied in order to maximize successful grasp range and minimize contact forces for a wide range of target object sizes and positions. The number of actuators was also varied in order to test performance for varying degrees of underactuation. A normal distribution of object position was used to model sensing uncertainty and weight the results accordingly. There are three main results: distal/proximal joint torque ratios of around 1.0 produced the best results, both for cases in which sensory information available for the task was poor and when sensing was good; an actuator for each gripper finger performs no better than a single actuator for both fingers; and that for good sensing, the gripper should be positioned off-center from the object, resulting in an increased lever arm and lower unbalanced contact forces on the object.},

abstract = {We present a decentralized algorithmic approach to automatically building user-specified three-dimensional structures from modular units. Our bipartite system comprises passive units (blocks), responsible for embodying the structure and determining where further units can legally be attached, and active units (robots), responsible for transporting passive units. The algorithmic issues are correspondingly decomposed into two parts: (1) deciding where passive units may be attached; and (2) getting them to those locations. For the first part, we give simple, scalable rules for attachment and prove that they will reliably lead to the construction of any desired structure from a large class of three-dimensional shapes. For the second part, we compare three approaches: random movement, systematic search and gradient-following; each approach is successively faster but requires more communication overhead and/or unit capabilities. The system we describe enables guaranteed construction of desired structures using very simple agent algorithms, taking a high-level specification as the only required input. The topic of collective construction is related to the problems of programmed self-assembly and self-reconfiguration in modular robots, and the rules governing block attachment presented here may be usefully applied to such systems.},

@article{Guest2008,
abstract = {This paper presents algorithms for solving structural topology optimization problems with uncertainty in the magnitude and location of the applied loads and with small uncertainty in the location of the structural nodes. The second type of uncertainty would typically arise from fabrication errors where the tolerances for the node locations are small in relation to the length scale of the structural elements. We first review the discrete form of the uncertain loads problem, which has been previously solved using a weighted average of multiple load patterns. With minor modifications, we extend this solution to include loads described by continuous joint probability density functions. We then proceed to the main contribution of this paper: structural optimization under uncertainty in the nodal locations. This optimization problem is computationally difficult because it involves variations of the inverse of the structural stiffness matrix. It is shown, however, that for small uncertainties the problem can be recast into a simpler but equivalent structural optimization problem with equivalent uncertain loads. By expressing these equivalent loads in terms of continuous random variables, we are able to make use of the extended form of the uncertain loads problem presented in the first part of this paper. The optimization algorithms are developed in the context of minimum compliance (maximum stiffness) design. Simple examples are presented. The results demonstrate that load and nodal uncertainties can have dramatic impact on optimal design. For structures containing thin substructures under axial loads, it is shown that these uncertainties (a) are of first-order significance, influencing the linear elastic response quantities, and (b) can affect designs by avoiding unrealistically optimistic and potentially unstable structures. The additional computational cost associated with the uncertainties scales linearly with the number of uncertainties and is insignificant compared to the cost associated with solving the deterministic structural optimization problem. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {— Soft robots have recently demonstrated impressive abilities to adapt to objects and their environment with limited sensing and actuation. However, mobile soft robots are typically fabricated using laborious molding processes that result in lim-ited actuated degrees of freedom and hence limited locomotion capabilities. In this paper, we present a 3D printed robot with bellowed soft legs capable of rotation about two axes. This allows our robot to navigate rough terrain that previously posed a significant challenge to soft robots. We present models and FEM simulations for the soft leg modules and predict the robot locomotion capabilities. We use finite element analysis to simulate the actuation characteristics of these modules. We then compared the analytical and computational results to ex-perimental results with a tethered prototype. The experimental soft robot is capable of lifting its legs 5.3 cm off the ground and is able to walk at speeds up to 20 mm/s (0.13 bl/s). This work represents a practical approach to the design and fabrication of functional mobile soft robots.},

The core idea in AutoMoDe recalls the approach commonly adopted in machine learning for dealing with the bias-variance tradedoff: to obtain suitably general solutions with low variance, an appropriate design bias is injected. AutoMoDe produces robot control software by selecting, instantiating, and combining preexisting parametric modules-the injected bias. The resulting control software is a probabilistic finite state machine in which the topology, the transition rules and the values of the parameters are obtained automatically via an optimization process that maximizes a task-specific objective function. As a proof of concept, we define AutoMoDe-Vanilla, which is a specialization of AutoMoDe for the e-puck robot. We use AutoMoDe-Vanilla to design the robot control software for two different tasks: aggregation and foraging. The results show that the control software produced by AutoMoDe-Vanilla (i) yields good results, (ii) appears to be robust to the so called reality gap, and (iii) is naturally human-readable. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Nanoscale observation of beetle's attachment systems has revealed various exquisite multiscale architectures for essential functions such as wing fixation, crawling, mating, and protection from predators. Some of these adhesion systems are mediated by liquid secretion (capillary force), whereas some are purely operated by direct interlocking of high-density microfibers or contact of mushroom-like hairy structures (van der Waals force). In this review, we present an overview of recent advances in beetle-inspired, artificial dry and wet adhesives in the context of nanofabrication and material properties. For convenience, the beetle's adhesions from wing to tiptoe are classified into four types: hair interlocking, mushroom-shaped pads, oil-assisted spatula-shaped pads, and claws. After introducing the structural features and functions of these systems, we describe how the current nanofabrication methods can be applied to mimic or exploit the systems. Furthermore, relevant beetle-inspired structural materials, devices (fastener, medical tape, electric connector, etc.) and microrobots are briefly overviewed, which would shed light on future smart, directional and reversible adhesion systems. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Locomotion results from complex, high-dimensional, non-linear, dynamically coupled interactions between an organism and its environment. Fortunately, simple models we call templates have been and can be made to resolve the redundancy of multiple legs, joints and muscles by seeking synergies and symmetries. A template is the simplest model (least number of variables and parameters) that exhibits a targeted behavior. For example, diverse species that differ in skeletal type, leg number and posture run in a stable manner like sagittal- and horizontal-plane spring-mass systems. Templates suggest control strategies that can be tested against empirical data. Templates must be grounded in more detailed morphological and physiological models to ask specific questions about multiple legs, the joint torques that actuate them, the recruitment of muscles that produce those torques and the neural networks that activate the ensemble. We term these more elaborate models anchors. They introduce representations of specific biological details whose mechanism of coordination is of interest. Since mechanisms require controls, anchors incorporate specific hypotheses concerning the manner in which unnecessary motion or energy from legs, joints and muscles is removed, leaving behind the behavior of the body in the low-degree-of-freedom template. Locating the origin of control is a challenge because neural and mechanical systems are dynamically coupled and both play a role. The control of slow, variable-frequency locomotion appears to be dominated by the nervous system, whereas during rapid, rhythmic locomotion, the control may reside more within the mechanical system. Anchored templates of many-legged, sprawled-postured animals suggest that passive, dynamic self-stabilization from a feedforward, tuned mechanical system can reject rapid perturbations and simplify control. Future progress would benefit from the creation of a field embracing comparative neuromechanics.},

They measured the 'diversity' and 'specialization' of their swarm with special metrics, and found that their optimization resulted in high diversity/specialization when there were fewer robots than sticks, and was almost useless when there were more robots than sticks. They also extended the stick-pulling problem to require k robots collaborating to successfully pull a stick. They tested the same and found similar results for this generalization. They also found that dividing robots into 4 homogenous 'castes' made learning more effective on the generalized k-robot stick-pulling problem, whereas it was a hinderance with the original stick-pulling problem.},

The control law is adaptive in that it uses sensor measurements to learn the distribu- tion of sensory information in the environment. It is decentralized in that it requires only information local to each robot. The controller is then improved by introducing a consensus algorithm to propagate sensory information from every robot throughout the network. Con- vergence and consensus of parameters is proven with a Lyapunov- type proof. The controller with and without consensus is demonstrated in numerical simulations. These techniques are suggestive of broader applications of adaptive control methodologies to decentralized con- trol problems in unknown dynamic environments.},

A type of piezoceramic composite actuator known as Macro-Fiber Composite (MFC) is used for changing the camber of all control surfaces on the aircraft. The aircraft is analyzed theoretically for its two- and three- dimensional aerodynamic characteristics to aid the design of the piezoelectric control surfaces. A vortex-lattice analysis complemented the database of aerodynamic derivatives used to analyze control response. Steady state roll rates are measured in a wind tunnel and compared to a similar aircraft with servomotor actuated control surfaces. The theoretical analysis and wind tunnel testing demonstrated the stability and control authority of the concept, culminating in a landmark first flight of the completely MFC controlled aircraft on April 29, 2010. An electric motor driven propulsion system is used to generate thrust and all systems (including the high voltage converters) are powered with a single Lithium-Polymer battery. This vehicle became the first completely MFC controlled, flight tested aircraft. It is also known to be the first fully solid-state piezoelectric material controlled, non-tethered, flight tested fixed-wing aircraft.},

abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots equipped with arms have the potential to be used for automated construction of structures in various sizes and shapes, such as houses or other infrastructures. Existing construction processes, like many other additive manufacturing processes, are mostly based on precise positioning, which is achieved by machines that have a fixed mechanical link with the construction and therefore relying on absolute positioning. Mobile robots, by nature, do not have a fixed referential point, and their positioning systems are not as accurate as fixed-based systems. Therefore, mobile robots have to employ new technologies and/or methods to implement precise construction processes. In contrast to the majority of prior work on autonomous construction that has relied only on external tracking systems (e.g., GPS) or exclusively on short-range relative localization (e.g., stigmergy), this paper explores localization methods based on a combination of long-range self-positioning and short-range relative localization for robots to construct precise, separated artifacts in particular situations, such as in outer space or in indoor environments, where external support is not an option. Achieving both precision and autonomy in construction tasks requires understanding the environment and physically interacting with it. Consequently, we must evaluate the robot's key capabilities of navigation and manipulation for performing the construction in order to analyze the impact of these capabilities on a predefined construction. In this paper, we focus on the precision of autonomous construction of separated artifacts. This domain motivates us to combine two methods used for the construction: 1) a self-positioning system and 2) a short-distance relative localization. We evaluate our approach on a miniature mobile robot that autonomously maps an environment using a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm; the robot's objective is then to manipulate blocks to build desired artifacts based on a plan given by a human. Our results illuminate practical issues for future applications that also need to integrate complex tasks under mobile robot constraints.},

This sheet manipulation requires the development of a model of a bent sheet grasped with fingertips. We investigated the relationship between the grasping force and bending of the sheet and developed a bent sheet model. We also performed exper-iments on the sheet grasping stability with a focus on the resistible force, which is defined as the maximum external force at which a fingertip can maintain contact when applying an external force. The main findings and contributions are as follows. 1) After the sheet buckles, the grasping force only increases slightly even if the fingertip pressure is increased. 2) The range of the appli-cable grasping forces depends on the stiffness of the fingertips. Stiffer fingertips cannot provide a small grasping force but can resist large external forces. Softer fingertips can provide a small grasping force but cannot resist large external forces. 3) A grasp-ing strategy for sheet manipulation is presented that is based on controlling the stiffness of the fingertips.},

abstract = {Dry stone constructions date as far back as 9000 BC and are associated with the first stable human settlements in the cradle of human civilization. Agricultural tools and permanent settlements led to sustained domestication of crops, and consequently a continuous co-evolution of humans and their environment. The tools adopted widely by contemporary society are related to processing and visualizing information. It has been suggested that based on the information gathered from the environment, architecture itself could become responsive to the real environment. This research seeks to attain a constant modification of the built environment on a small scale, rather than a large scale stepwise engagement. We suggest that representations of information should be closely coupled with the built environment, and that the built environment should be conjoined in real-time communication with multiple different representations, enabling sense-making and suggesting potential future states. Through physical construction and design experimentation, representations of potential modifications, or articulations, are overlaid onto the environment. It is however important that these articulations be in constant flux based on the ongoing communication between environment and representations of it. We propose a computational material supported by a framework that would link computation and environment in constant bi-directional communication and continuous, stepwise development. We propose a methodology composed of scanning the environment, real-time computation, guidance, and construction visualization that would lead to a new approach of evolving the digital into a new physical reality. Future mixed reality architecture applications could make use of computational composites in order to fuse design and construction.},

The robot swarm is based on the toy “bristlebot”; a simple vibrating motor mounted on top of bristles to propel the body forward. Since shape largely determines the details of physical interactions, the robot behavior is altered by carefully designing its geometry instead of uploading a digital program. Through this mechanical programming, we plan to investigate how to tune emergent structural properties such as the size and temporal stability of assemblies.

abstract = {Through many recent successes in simulation, model-free reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising approach to solving continuous control robotic tasks. The research community is now able to reproduce, analyze and build quickly on these results due to open source implementations of learning algorithms and simulated benchmark tasks. To carry forward these successes to real-world applications, it is crucial to withhold utilizing the unique advantages of simulations that do not transfer to the real world and experiment directly with physical robots. However, reinforcement learning research with physical robots faces substantial resistance due to the lack of benchmark tasks and supporting source code. In this work, we introduce several reinforcement learning tasks with multiple commercially available robots that present varying levels of learning difficulty, setup, and repeatability. On these tasks, we test the learning performance of off-the-shelf implementations of four reinforcement learning algorithms and analyze sensitivity to their hyper-parameters to determine their readiness for applications in various real-world tasks. Our results show that with a careful setup of the task interface and computations, some of these implementations can be readily applicable to physical robots. We find that state-of-the-art learning algorithms are highly sensitive to their hyper-parameters and their relative ordering does not transfer across tasks, indicating the necessity of re-tuning them for each task for best performance. On the other hand, the best hyper-parameter configuration from one task may often result in effective learning on held-out tasks even with different robots, providing a reasonable default. We make the benchmark tasks publicly available to enhance reproducibility in real-world reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {? 2016 IEEE.Despite the prevalent use of robotic technologies in industrial manufacturing, their use on building construction sites is still very limited. This is mainly due to the unstructured nature of construction sites and the fact that the structures built must be larger than the machines which build them. This paper addresses these difficulties by presenting a repositioning and localization system which, using purely on-board sensing, allows a mobile robot to maintain a high degree of end-effector positioning accuracy while moving among numerous building positions during a building task. We introduce a newly developed machine, called the In situ Fabricator (IF), whose goal is to bring digital fabrication to the construction site. The capabilities of the repositioning and localization system is demonstrated through the construction of a vertical stack of bricks, in which the IF repositions itself after placing each brick. With this experiment, we demonstrate that the IF can build with sub-centimeter accuracy over long building sequences.},

abstract = {Robots have the potential to display a higher degree of lifetime morphological adaptation than natural organisms. By adopting a modular approach, robots with different capabilities, shapes, and sizes could, in theory, construct and reconfigure themselves as required. However, current modular robots have only been able to display a limited range of hardwired behaviors because they rely solely on distributed control. Here, we present robots whose bodies and control systems can merge to form entirely new robots that retain full sensorimotor control. Our control paradigm enables robots to exhibit properties that go beyond those of any existing machine or of any biological organism: the robots we present can merge to form larger bodies with a single centralized controller, split into separate bodies with independent controllers, and self-heal by removing or replacing malfunctioning body parts. This work takes us closer to robots that can autonomously change their size, form and function.},

In multi robot systems simple robots are allowed to coordinate with each other to achieve some well defined goals.

The simplicity of multi-robots have produced a potentially wide set of applications such as military missions (battlefield surveillance), searching for survivors in disaster hit areas, parallel and simultaneous transportation of vehicles, and delivery of payloads. Although the research on multi-robot systems has attracted considerable attention worldwide in the past decade, the research in this area is still in its infancy.

abstract = {The work done during each step to lift and to reaccelerate (in the forward direction) and center of mass has been measured during locomotion in bipeds (rhea and turkey), quadrupeds (dogs, stump-tailed macaques, and ram), and hoppers (kangaroo and springhare). Walking, in all animals (as in man), involves an alternate transfer between gravitational-potential energy and kinetic energy within each stride (as takes place in a pendulum). This transfer is greatest at intermediate walking speeds and can account for up to 70{\%} of the total energy changes taking place within a stride, leaving only 30{\%} to be supplied by muscles. No kinetic-gravitational energy transfer takes place during running, hopping, and trotting, but energy is conserved by another mechanism: an elastic “bounce” of the body. Galloping animals utilize a combination of these two energy-conserving mechanisms. During running, trotting, hopping, and galloping, 1) the power per unit weight required to maintain the forward speed of the center of mass is almost the same in all the species studied; 2) the power per unit weight required to lift the center of mass is almost independent of speed; and 3) the sum of these two powers is almost a linear function of speed.},

@article{Christensen2010,
abstract = {In this paper, we address the challenge of realizing full-body behaviors in scalable modular robots. We present an experimental study of a biologically inspired approach to organize the morphology and control of modular robots. The approach introduces a nested hierarchy that decomposes the complexity of assembling and commanding a functional robot made of numerous simple modules. The purpose is to support versatility, scalability, and provide design abstraction. The robots we describe incorporate anatomy-inspired parts such as muscles, bones, and joints, and these parts in turn are assembled from modules. Each of those parts encapsulates one or more functions, e. g., a muscle can contract. Control of the robot can then be cast as a problem of controlling its anatomical parts rather than each discrete module. To validate this approach, we perform experiments with micron-scale spherical catom modules in simulation. The robots we simulate are increasingly complex and include snake, crawler, quadruped, cilia surface, arm-joint-muscle, and grasping robots. We conclude that this is a promising approach for future microscopic many-modules systems, but also that it is not applicable to relatively weak and slow homogeneous systems such as the centimeter-scale ATRON.  2010 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

abstract = {Nest construction is an impressive achievement for social insects. They employ templates (or patterns) in the environment to guide construction tasks and robot swarms can use similar mechanisms. Early work examined how a spatio-temporal varying template can be utilized by a swarm of minimalist robots to build the framework for a linear wall. From this, it became clear that a method for regulating construction in a variable environment was needed. To this end, a social insect inspired distributed feedback mechanism is proposed and verified. Direct and indirect transfer of information between individuals, through the use of signals and cues, is shown to facilitate closure of a feedback loop allowing the system to operate close to optimally. Perturbation experiments demonstrate the robotic swarm's ability to adapt to environmental changes. The work described in this paper provides the basis for a distributed robotic system capable of constructing any given planar structure - a goal implicit in many of the suggested applications for collective construction.

Although underactuated hands are generally not con-sidered to be adept at dexterous tasks, we have found through past work that an underac-tuated manipulator can control n degrees of freedom with n actuators by leveraging the passive compliance to satisfy contact constraints on the object. Assuming the system to be quasi-static, the workspace of the underactuated mechanism is found through constraint-based energy minimization by sweeping through the set of allowable inputs. In this study, we investigate achievable workspaces by exploring the nondimensionalized design space, consisting of linkage ratio, joint stiffness ratio, transmission ratio, base linkage length, and object linkage length. The results of this study are useful in motivating the design of dexterous, underactuated manipulators, as well as to predict the achievable workspace of specific hand/object configurations.},

@article{Schwind1998,
abstract = {The spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) has emerged as the "right" template for studying dynamic locomotion, whether in robots or animals. The SLIP template, which is nothing more than a mass on a spring (a simple pogo stick), has not only accurately modeled the most successful running robots built to date, but also has proven a good descriptive model for the center of mass trajectories for runners as diverse as humans, horses, cockroaches and crabs. The conceptual simplicity of this model, however, hides its analytical complexity. Until now, one consequence of this complexity has been the absence of an appropriate plant model. In this work the "appropriate" plant is not found in the SLIP's continuous dynamics, but rather a discrete manifestation of those dynamics. Unfortunately, the development of such a plant model is hindered by the non-integrability of the SLIP stance dynamics. This has prevented the SLIP template from being leveraged to greater advantage in both robotics and biomechanics research. The work presented in this dissertation provides a means to remove some of the analytical difficulties encountered in the pursuit of a SLIP plant model. In particular, novel approximation strategies that rely on an extension of the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals and Picard-style iterates are used to "integrate" the stance dynamics, resulting in a set of plant models, the iterates, which grow in both accuracy and complexity in a controlled manner. An initial application of a plant model generated in this manner is the identification of SLIP spring laws in human running. The accuracy of the fits obtained in the initial study presented in this dissertation suggest that the SLIP template is more than just a useful metaphor for human running-it may be a literal control target.},

abstract = {Establishing adequate RF (Radio Frequency) connectivity is the basic requirement for the proper operation of any wireless network. In a mobile wireless network it is a challenge for applications and protocols to deal with connectivity problems, as links might get up and down frequently. In these scenarios, having knowledge of the node remaining connectivity time can avoid unnecessary or even unuseful control/data messages transmissions. The current paper presents the so-called Genetic Machine Learning Approach for Link Quality Prediction, or simply GMLA, which is a solution to forecast the remainder RF connectivity time in mobile environments. Differently from all related works, GMLA allows building connectivity knowledge to estimate the RF link duration without the need of a pre-runtime phase. This allows to apply GMLA at unknown environments and mobility patterns. Its structure combines a Classifier System with a Markov chain model of the RF link quality. As the Markov model parameters are discovered on-the-fly, there is no need of a previous history to feed the Markov model. Obtained simulation results show that GMLA is a very suitable solution, as it outperforms approaches that use geographical positioning systems (GPS) and also approaches that use link-quality prediction, such as BD and MTCP. GMLA is generic enough to be applied to any layer of the communication protocol stack, especially in the link and network layers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The ATRON self-reconfigurable robot consists of simple interconnected modules. Modules move relative to other modules and as a result change the shape of the robot. The ATRON modules are difficult to control because of complex motion constraints on the modules. Motion constraints are reduced by using meta-modules composed of three modules. A meta-module may emerge from unstructured groups of modules if three modules are connected in the right configuration. The meta-module then moves on a surface of modules and stop at another position. To attract moving meta-modules and thereby to specify the shape-changing task of the robot we use attraction-points. In this work we evolve a distributed artificial neural network controller for the modules. The controller is identical on every module and controls when a meta-module emerges, how it move and when it stops. In simulation we demonstrate how this control strategy allows the ATRON robot to shape-change to support an unstable roof, build a bridge across a gap and to self-repair a broken bone. We conclude that the control strategy is able to shape-change and self-repair the ATRON robot independent on whether it consists of dozens, hundreds or thousands of modules.},

abstract = {The work done at each step during level walking and running to lift the centre of mass of the body, Wv, and to increase its forward speed, Wf, and the total mechanical energy involved (potential + kinetic) Wext, have been measured at various 'constant' speeds (2-32 km/hr) with the technique described by Cavagna (1975). 2. At intermediate speeds of walking (about 4 km/hr) Wv = Wf and Wext/km is at a minimum, as is the energy cost. At lower speeds Wv greater than Wf whereas at higher speeds Wf greather than Wv: in both cases Wext/km increases. 3. The recovery of mechanical energy, through the pendular motion characteristic of walking, was measured as (/Wv/ + /Wf/ - Wext)/(/Wv/ + /Wf/): it attains a maximum (about 65{\%}) at intermediate speeds. 4. A simple model, assuming that in walking the body rotates as an inverted pendulum over the foot in contact with the ground, fits the experimental data better at intermediate speeds but is no longer tenable above 7 km/hr. 5. In running the recovery defined above is minimal (0-4{\%} independent of speed), i.e. Wext congruent to /Wv/ + /Wf/: potential and kinetic energy of the body do not interchange but are simultaneously taken up and released by the muscles with a rate increasing markedly with the speed (from about 1 to 4 h.p.). 6. Wext increases linearly with the running speed Vf from a positive y intercept owing to the fact that Wv is practically constant independent of Vf. On the contrary, Wf = aVf2/(1 + bVf), where b is the ratio between the time spent in the air and the forward distance covered while on the ground during each step.},

abstract = {New models and theories of legged locomotion are needed to better explain and predict the robustly stable legged locomotion of animals and some bio-inspired robots. In this paper we observe that a hip-torque and leg-damping mechanism is fundamental to many legged robots and some animals and determine its affect on locomotion dynamics. We discuss why this hip-torque-and-leg-damping mechanism is not so easily understood. We investigate how hip-torque and leg-damping affect the stability and robustness of locomotion using a mathematical model: First, we extend the canonical spring-loaded-inverted-pendulum model to include constant hip torque and leg damping proportional to leg length speed. Then, we calculate the stability and robustness of locomotion as a function of increasing levels of torque and damping, starting from zero-the energy conserving and marginally stable special case-to high levels of torque and damping. We find that the stabilizing effects of hip-torque and leg-damping occur in the context of the piecewise-continuous dynamics of legged locomotion, and so linear intuition does not apply. We discover that adding hip torque and leg damping changes the stability of legged locomotion in an unexpected way. When a small amount of torque and damping are added, legged locomotion is initially destabilized. As more torque and damping are added, legged locomotion turns stable and becomes increasingly more stable and more robust the more torque and damping are added. Also, stable locomotion becomes more probable over the biologically-relevant region of the parameter space, indicating greater prediction and explanatory capabilities of the model. These results provide a more clear understanding of the hip-torque-and-leg-damping mechanism of legged locomotion, and extend existing theory of legged locomotion towards a greater understanding of robustly stable locomotion.},

Yet, it is still poorly understood and as such its full power remains underappre-ciated. The present paper clarifies the issue by defining stigmergy as a mechanism of indirect coordination in which the trace left by an action in a medium stimulates subsequent actions. It then analyses the fundamental concepts used in the definition: action, agent, med-ium, trace and coordination. It clarifies how stigmergy enables complex, coordinated activity without any need for planning, control, communication, simultaneous presence, or even mutual awareness. The resulting self-organization is driven by a combination of positive and negative feedbacks, amplifying beneficial developments while suppressing errors. Thus, stigmergy is applicable to a very broad vari-ety of cases, from chemical reactions to bodily coordination and Internet-supported collaboration in Wikipedia.},

abstract = {? 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.We study the detailed locomotor mechanics of a small, lightweight robot (DynaRoACH, 10 cm, 25 g) which can move on a granular substrate of closely packed 3 mm diameter glass particles at speeds up to 50 cm/s (5 body length/s), approaching the performance of small, highperforming, desert-dwelling lizards. To reveal how the robot achieves this high performance, we use high speed imaging to capture kinematics, and develop a numerical multi-body simulation of the robot coupled to an experimentally validated discrete element method (DEM) simulation of the granular media. Average forward speeds measured in both experiment and simulation agreed well, and increased non-linearly with stride frequency, reflecting a change in the mode of propulsion. At low frequencies, the robot used a quasi-static "rotary walking" mode, in which the granular material yielded as the legs penetrated and then solidified once vertical force balance was achieved. At high frequencies, duty factor decreased below 0.5 and aerial phases occurred. The propulsion mechanism was qualitatively different: the robot ran rapidly by utilizing the speed-dependent fluid-like inertial response of the material. We also used our simulation tool to vary substrate parameters that were inconvenient to vary in experiment (e.g., granular particle friction) to test performance and reveal limits of stability of the robot. Using small robots as physical models, our study reveals a mechanism by which small animals can achieve high performance on granular substrates, which in return advances the design and control of small robots in deformable terrains.},

In this paper, we discuss the hardware system and distributed control method of AMAS. This system uses passive building blocks called "structure modules" and an assembler robot that is specialized to handle them. This "modular" concept drastically simplifies structural complexity. We have built a prototype model to evaluate its automatic construction capability. Then we introduce a distributed autonomous control for AMAS, which uses a gradient field to indicate the directions to the assembler robots. The gradient field is generated on the structure modules. To improve the efficiency, we introduce collision avoidance rules such as module relay and local negotiation via a blackboard. We also evaluate the overall performance of the distributed control with simulations.},

Semiconductor research began quite inconspicuously about 120 years ago with some observations on the electrical properties of silver suphide. Progress was very slow for the next 50 years and then, about 1885, a mild interest developed with the discovery of point contact rectifiers. These devices were used as detectors until displaced by the vacuum tube around 1915. Development of selenium and cuprous oxide rectifiers about 1930 revived interest and the publication of a good theory of semiconductors in 1931 added still more momentum. The next period of active interest came around World War II when the catwhisker diode was revived and developed into an excellent radar detector. The announcement of the transistor in 1948 gave this field of research such a boost that it has become a real giant in the last few years and semiconductor electronics now rates as a major field of endeavor.},

We focus primarily on the tripod grasp, which is the most commonly used grasp for precision manipulation. We systematically explore the space of design parameters, with two main objectives: maximize the workspace of a fully actuated hand and explore how under-actuation modifies it. We use a mathematical framework that models the hand-plus-object system and examine how the workspace varies with changes in nine hand and object parameters such as link length and finger arrangement on the palm.Results show that to achieve the largest workspaces the palm radius should be approximately half of a finger length larger than the target object radius, that the distal link of the two-link fingers should be around 1–1.2 times the length of the proximal link, and that fingers should be arranged symmetrically about the palm with object contacts also symmetric. Furthermore, a proper parameter design for an under-actuated hand can achieve up to 50{\%} of the workspace of a fully actuated hand. When compared to the system parameters of existing popular hand designs, larger palms and longer distal links are needed to maximize the manipulation workspace of the studied design.},

abstract = { In this paper we present generic distributed algorithms for assembling and repairing shapes using modular self-reconfiguring robots. The algorithms work in the sliding cube model. Each module independently evaluates a set of local rules using different evaluation models. Two methods are used to determine the correctness of the algorithms - a graph analysis technique which can prove the rule set is correct for specific instances of the algorithm, and a statistical technique which can produce arbitrary bounds on the likelihood that the rule set functions correctly. An extension of the assembly algorithm can be used to produce arbitrary non-cantilevered convex shapes without holes. The algorithms have been implemented and evaluated in simulation.},

abstract = {We propose a new process for continuously reconfigurable robotics. Given a task, a robot evolves a suitable morphology and control, then prints the assembled 3D structure, downloads into it and performs the task, and then recycles into a different form for the next task. This approach relinquishes the need to adhere to discrete or fixed components as well as manually designed configurations. Although the technology for fully realizing the proposed concept is not entirely available, we have demonstrated a first case: Given the task of locomotion, various robots with different mechanics and control are evolved automatically. The design space is comprised of only linear actuators and sigmoidal control neurons embodied in an arbitrary thermoplastic body. The robots then print pre-assembled using rapid prototyping technology, and perform the task in reality. The robots are then recycled. This paper described one implementation and provides examples of successful physical robots generated by the proposed process},

We also extend the algorithm to be adaptive to the availability of parts. When a part is not available, the assembly sequence is recomputed. The algorithms are provably convergent and their execution does not depend on the size of the robot team.

abstract = {—The spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model describes well the steady-state center-of-mass motions of a diverse range of walking and running animals and robots. Here we ask whether the SLIP model can also explain the dynamic stability of these gaits, and we find that it cannot do so in many physically-relevant parameter ranges. We develop an actuated, lossy, clock-torqued SLIP, or CT-SLIP, with more realistic hip-motor torque inputs, that can capture the robust stability properties observed in most animals and some legged robots. Variations of CT-SLIP at a similar level of detail and complexity may also be appropriate for capturing the whole-system center-of-mass dynamics of locomotion of legged animals and robots varying widely in size and morphology. This paper contributes to a broader program to develop mathematical models, at varied levels of detail, that capture the dynamics of integrated organismal systems exhibiting integrated whole-body motion. 1. SIMPLE MODELS FOR COMPLICATED SYSTEMS Many legged animals and robots move in a manner resembling a monopod bouncing along: mea-surements taken during steady locomotion from species varying widely in morphology and size reveal net center of mass (CoM) forces and trajectories remarkably similar to those of a pogo-stick, or more precisely, a point-mass atop a passively-sprung massless leg [1–3]: see Fig. 1. This is referred to as the spring-mass model of locomotion, or more formally as the spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP). This paper describes a simple extension and improvement of the SLIP, inspired by the legged robot RHex [4, 5], and generalizable to a wide range of systems. Our basic premise is that low-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), describing classical point mass and rigid body dynamics subject to suitable forcing or activation, can account for dominant effects in complex elec-tromechanical and biological systems. Such models or templates, in the terminology of [6], have been successfully used to reproduce and explain the dynamics of running animals [7–9], and they allow the analytical and computational methods of dynamical systems and stability and bifurcation theory to be applied to such phenomena. For further background, including an extensive review of related work on legged locomotion and 'bio-inspired' robot design, see [10]. Also, see [11] and the issue in which it is found [12], for an overview of locomotion, modeling, and some implications for robotics research. In this introductory section we review the simple spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model, pointing out its advantages and deficiencies, and lay out our strategy. The rest of the paper concerns extensions of the SLIP that address specific properties of the robot.

abstract = {The objective of this work is to analyze embodied evolution based algorithms in coordinated multi-robot tasks that require specialization. This type of algorithm performs a Darwinian open-ended evolution where the individuals that make up the population are embodied in the physical robots and situated in an environment. The robots interact autonomously in an asynchronous fashion, leading to a complex dynamic system in continuous evolution with dependencies among parameters that make theoretical studies of specialization quite difficult in real cases. Consequently, the aim here is to perform a theoretical analysis of this type of embodied evolution based algorithms, establishing a set of canonical parameters that define their operation. A generic algorithm of this type is designed that allows us to formally study the relevance of the canonical parameters. In this paper this study concentrates on specialization for the construction of heterogeneous robotic teams. The conclusions obtained in the theoretical framework are confirmed in a real multi-robot collective gathering task using one of the many real embodied evolution based algorithms and showing that two canonical parameters are the most relevant in terms of specialization for this type of algorithms. Some insights into how to adjust these canonical parameters in a real problem are provided. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Yet, it remains an open question as to how to program large swarms of robotic modules so that the assembly task is performed as efficiently as possible. Moreover, the problem of designing assembly algorithms is compounded by the scale of these systems, and by the lack of centralized guidance in unstructured environments. The main contribution of this work is a decentralized algorithm to assemble structures with modular robots. Importantly, we coordinate the robots so that docking actions can be parallelized. We show the correctness of our algorithm, and we demonstrate its scalability and generality through multiple scenarios in simulation. Experiments on physical robots demonstrate the validity of our approach in real-world settings.},

abstract = {To assess energetic costs during rest and locomotion in a small insect, we measured metabolic rate in freely moving ants Camponotus sp. (average body mass 11.9 mg). The animals ran in a straight respirometric chamber in which locomotor speed and CO2 release were monitored simultaneously using flow-through respirometry and conventional video analysis. In resting intact ants, standard metabolic rate was on average 0.32 ml CO2 g(-1) body mass h(-1). During walking, the ants breathed continuously and metabolic rate increased between 4.3 times (level walking at 0-5 mm s(-1)) and 6.9 times (30 degrees ascent at 85-95 mm s(-1)) over resting rates. Metabolic rate increased linearly with increasing walking speed but superficially leveled off beyond speeds of about 70 mm s(-1). Walking on incline (uphill) or decline slopes (downhill) of up to 60 degrees had only a small effect on energy consumption compared to level walking. During slope walking, total metabolic rate averaged over all running speeds ranged from a minimum of 1.55+/-0.4 (horizontal running) to a maximum of 1.89+/-0.7 ml CO2 h(-1) g(-1) body mass (30 degrees downhill). The mean cost of transport in Camponotus was approximately 130 J g(-1) km(-1). The metabolic requirements in the comparatively small insect Camponotus for walking were mostly in the range expected from data obtained from other insects and small poikilotherms, and from allometric scaling laws.},

abstract = {The joint coupling necessary to allow for underactuation is often accomplished through compliance in the manipulator structure. Compliance is perhaps the simplest way to allow for coupling between joints without enforcing the fixed-motion coupling relationship inherent with gear or linkage couplings. Compliant couplings are a simple way to allow a joint to passively deflect without causing a fixed-motion proportional change in the joints to which it is coupled. ABSTRACT This paper examines the nature of joint coupling in underactuated grippers for environments where object properties and location may not be well known. A grasper consisting of a pair of two-link planar fingers with compliant revolute joints was simulated as it was actuated after contact with a target object. The joint coupling configuration of the gripper was varied in order to maximize successful grasp range and minimize contact forces for a wide range of target object size and position. A normal distribution of object position was assumed in order to model sensing uncertainty and weight the results accordingly. The results show that proximal-distal joint torque ratios of around 0.6 produced the best results for cases in which sensory information available for the task was poor, and ratios of around 1.0 produced the best results for cases in which sensory information available for the task was good. Compliant underactuated grippers show particular promise for use in unstructured environments, where object properties are not known a priori and sensing is prone to error. Finger compliance allows the gripper to passively conform to a wide range of objects while minimizing contact forces. Passive compliance offers additional benefits, particularly in impacts, where control loop delays may lead to poor control of contact forces [1,2]. Compliance can also lower implementation costs by reducing the sensing and actuation required for the gripper. In previous work, we examined the optimization of the preshape and joint stiffness of simple two-fingered grippers with passive springs in the joints. This study showed that for a particular set of joint stiffnesses and rest angles, the widest range of range of uncertainty in object size and location could be allowed for. Contact forces were also minimized at approximately the same gripper configuration. In addition to simulation studies, these results were confirmed with experimental tests using a reconfigurable gripper [3].},

abstract = {While robotic spatial extrusion has demonstrated a new and efficient means to fabricate 3D truss structures in architectural scale, a major challenge remains in automatically planning extrusion sequence and robotic motion for trusses with unconstrained topologies. This paper presents the first attempt in the field to rigorously formulate the extrusion sequence and motion planning (SAMP) problem, using a CSP encoding. Furthermore, this research proposes a new hierarchical planning framework to solve the extrusion SAMP problems that usually have a long planning horizon and 3D configuration complexity. By decoupling sequence and motion planning, the planning framework is able to efficiently solve the extrusion sequence, end-effector poses, joint configurations, and transition trajectories for spatial trusses with nonstandard topologies. This paper also presents the first detailed computation data to reveal the runtime bottleneck on solving SAMP problems, which provides insight and comparing baseline for future algorithmic development. Together with the algorithmic results, this paper also presents an open-source and modularized software implementation called Choreo that is machine-agnostic. To demonstrate the power of this algorithmic framework, three case studies, including real fabrication and simulation results, are presented.},

abstract = {Purpose – Passively compliant underactuated mechanisms are one way to obtain the gripper which could accommodate to any irregular and sensitive grasping object. The purpose of the underactuation is to use less active inputs than the number of degrees of freedom of the gripper mechanism to drive the open and close motion of the gripper. Another purpose of underaction is to reduce the number of control variables. Design/methodology/approach – The underactuation can morph shapes of the gripper to accommodate different objects. As a result, the underactuated grippers require less complex control algorithms. The fully compliant mechanism has multiple degrees of freedom and can be considered as an underactuated mechanism. Findings – This paper presents a new design of the adaptive underactuated compliant gripper with distributed compliance. The optimal topology of the gripper structure was obtained by optimality criteria method using mathematical programming technique. Afterwards, the obtained model was improved by iterative finite element optimization procedure. The gripper was constructed entirely of silicon rubber. Originality/value – The main points of this paper are the explanation of the development and production of the new compliant gripper structure.},

If biological inspiration can be used to build robots that deal robustly with complex environments, it should be possible to demonstrate that legged biorobots can function in natural environments. Firstly, we tried to report on theoretic work with a six legged robot designed to emulate spider behavior like walking, running and bounding. We demonstrated theoretically that it can successfully walk, run and bound like a spider over natural terrain. Secondly, limitations in its capability were evaluated, and many biologically based important improvements were obtained for future experimental work. Thirdly, the hexapod robot with bounding gait was controlled by proportional-derivative control algorithm and was carried out by using spring loaded inverted pendulum model. Consequently, the developed kinematic and dynamic methods, and control action method makes both the system control easy and the system performance is improved by decreasing the run time for each loop. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a cable-driven robot called SPIDERobot, that was developed for automated construction of architectural projects. This robot has a rotating claw and it is controlled by a set of 4 cables that allow 4 degrees of freedom. In addition to the robot, this paper introduces a Dynamic Control System (DCS) that controls the positioning of the robot and assures that the length of cables is always within a safe value. Results show that traditional force-feasible approaches are more influenced by the pulling forces or the geometric arrangement of all cables and their positioning is significantly less accurate than the DCS. Therefore, the architecture of the SPIDERobot is designed to enable an easily scaling up of the solution to higher dimensions for operating in realistic environments.},

abstract = {Many exciting robotic applications require multiple robots with many degrees of freedom, such as manipulators, to coordinate their motion in a shared workspace. Discovering high-quality paths in such scenarios can be achieved, in principle, by exploring the composite space of all robots. Sampling-based planners do so by building a roadmap or a tree data structure in the corresponding configuration space and can achieve asymptotic optimality. The hardness of motion planning, however, renders the explicit construction of such structures in the composite space of multiple robots impractical. This work proposes a scalable solution for such coupled multi-robot problems, which provides desirable path-quality guarantees and is also computationally efficient. In particular, the proposed ????∗dRRT∗$\backslash$mathtt{\{}dRRT{\^{}}*{\}} is an informed, asymptotically-optimal extension of a prior sampling-based multi-robot motion planner, ????dRRT$\backslash$mathtt{\{}dRRT{\}}. The prior approach introduced the idea of building roadmaps for each robot and implicitly searching the tensor product of these structures in the composite space. This work identifies the conditions for convergence to optimal paths in multi-robot problems, which the prior method was not achieving. Building on this analysis, ????dRRT$\backslash$mathtt{\{}dRRT{\}} is first properly adapted so as to achieve the theoretical guarantees and then further extended so as to make use of effective heuristics when searching the composite space of all robots. The case where the various robots share some degrees of freedom is also studied. Evaluation in simulation indicates that the new algorithm, ????∗dRRT∗$\backslash$mathtt{\{}dRRT{\^{}}*{\}} converges to high-quality paths quickly and scales to a higher number of robots where various alternatives fail. This work also demonstrates the planner's capability to solve problems involving multiple real-world robotic arms.},

abstract = {Printed electronics is becoming increasingly important in a variety of newly emerging areas. However, restricted to the rather limited conductive inks and available printing strategies, the current electronics manufacture is usually confined to industry level. Here, we show a highly cost-effective and entirely automatic printing way towards personal electronics making, through introducing a tapping-mode composite fluid delivery system. Fundamental mechanisms regarding the reliable printing, transfer and adhesion of the liquid metal inks on the substrate were disclosed through systematic theoretical interpretation and experimental measurements. With this liquid metal printer, a series of representative electronic patterns spanning from single wires to desired complex configurations such as integrated circuit (IC), printed-circuits-on-board (PCB), electronic paintings, or more do-it-yourself (DIY) devices, were demonstrated to be printed out with high precision in a moment. And the total machine cost already reached personally affordable price. This is hard to achieve by a conventional PCB technology which generally takes long time and is material, water and energy consuming, while the existing printed electronics is still far away from the real direct printing goal. The present work opens the way for large scale personal electronics manufacture and is expected to generate important value for the coming society.},

The sensor is made of a hyperelastic silicone elastomer that contains embedded microchannels filled with conductive liquids. This is an effort of improving the previously reported soft sensors that uses a single liquid conductor. The proposed sensor employs a hybrid approach involving two liquid conductors: an ionic solution and an eutectic gallium-indium alloy. This hybrid method reduces the sensitivity to noise that may be caused by variations in electrical resistance of the wire interface and undesired stress applied to signal routing areas. The bridge between these two liquids is made conductive by doping the elastomer locally with nickel nanoparticles. The design, fabrication, and characterization of the sensor are presented.},

abstract = {Six-legged pedestrians, cockroaches, use a running gait during locomotion. The gait was defined by measuring ground reaction forces and mechanical energy fluctuations of the center of mass in Blaberus discoidalis (Serville) as they travelled over a miniature force platform. These six-legged animals produce horizontal and vertical ground-reaction patterns of force similar to those found in two-, four- and eight-legged runners. Lateral forces were less than half the vertical force fluctuations. At speeds between 0.08 and 0.66 ms-1, horizontal kinetic and gravitational potential energy changes were in phase. This pattern of energy fluctuation characterizes the bouncing gaits used by other animals that run. Blaberus discoidalis attained a maximum sustainable stride frequency of 13 Hz at 0.35 ms-1, the same speed and frequency predicted for a mammal of the same mass. Despite differences in body form, the mass-specific energy used to move the center of mass a given distance (0.9 J kg-1m-1) was the same for cockroaches, ghost crabs, mammals, and birds. Similarities in force production, stride frequency and mechanical energy production during locomotion suggest that there may be common design constraints in terrestrial locomotion which scale with body mass and are relatively independent of body form, leg number and skeletal type.},

Due to the manipulator redundancy, the load distribution computed by means of a generalized inverse of the grasp matrix is not uniquely determined. Controversial results on the nonsqueezing property of specific load distributions exist in the literature. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for the analysis of internal wrenches based on the kinematic constraints imposed to the manipulator ensemble. We unify previous results by showing that there exists no unique nonsqueezing load distribution and illustrate the consequences of our findings by means of several examples. In particular, the presented results provide a new perspective on the decomposition of interaction forces into internal and external components as required for cooperative multimanipulator control schemes.},

@article{Ardiny,
abstract = {—After a terrible disaster such as an earthquake or a nuclear accident, finding victims and isolating them from hazards are usually the first priorities for rescuers. As the security of rescuers and the stabilization of the environment are critical components of the first rescue phase, we assume that robots could be used to secure the environment by performing construction tasks, to stabilize large structures, and/or protect the victims. In this paper we suggest an approach consisting of using mobile robots to construct protective walls on a site affected by a nuclear disaster. Protective walls can help to block radiation from toxic sources and protect both victims and rescuers. On the other hand, the robot's vulnerability to radiation restricts its freedom of movements into unsafe regions. Therefore, building protective walls needs a plan (construction plan) that involves three competing objectives: victim safety, rescuer safety, and robot safety. Weighting these factors is a societal choice, is not trivial, and impacts the whole system. In this paper, we provide and optimize the construction plan using a genetic algorithm based on three objectives. We analyze the construction plan performance with respect to execution time. We also analyze the trade-offs involved between these competing objectives in different environments with ranging physical complexity (e.g., a number of victims or sources).},

@article{Labonte2014,
abstract = {Many stick insects and mantophasmids possess tarsal 'heel pads' (euplantulae) covered by arrays of conical, micrometre-sized hairs (acanthae). These pads are used mainly under compression; they respond to load with increasing shear resistance, and show negligible adhesion. Reflected-light microscopy in stick insects (Carausius morosus) revealed that the contact area of 'heel pads' changes with normal load on three hierarchical levels. First, loading brought larger areas of the convex pads into contact. Second, loading increased the density of acanthae in contact. Third, higher loads changed the shape of individual hair contacts gradually from circular (tip contact) to elongated (side contact). The resulting increase in real contact area can explain the load dependence of friction, indicating a constant shear stress between acanthae and substrate. As the euplantula contact area is negligible for small loads (similar to hard materials), but increases sharply with load (resembling soft materials), these pads show high friction coefficients despite little adhesion. This property appears essential for the pads' use in locomotion. Several morphological characteristics of hairy friction pads are in apparent contrast to hairy pads used for adhesion, highlighting key adaptations for both pad types. Our results are relevant for the design of fibrillar structures with high friction coefficients but small adhesion.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the design of passive robotically-reconfigurable truss structures and progress towards a robot capable of manipulating such structures. The elements are designed to be inserted and removed singly in ldquorandom access,rdquo thus eliminating some assembly order constraints and enabling a physical realization of the construction process. The proposed robot is a ldquohingerdquo robot that can demonstrate manipulating said elements. The robot is also designed to be able to traverse arbitrary scale truss structures. With the addition of reconfiguration algorithms discussed by Lobo in [1], we suggest that such reconfigurable structures and robots could open the door to a machine metabolic process where structures are decomposed and recomposed autonomously to meet varying needs to a variety of applications from infrastructure recovery to space exploration.},

Predicting high-level results given low-level rules is a key open challenge; the inverse problem, finding low-level rules that give specific outcomes, is in general still less understood. We present a multi-agent construction system inspired by mound-building termites, solving such an inverse problem. A user specifies a desired structure, and the system automatically generates low-level rules for independent climbing robots that guarantee production of that structure. Robots use only local sensing and coordinate their activity via the shared environment. We demonstrate the approach via a physical realization with three autonomous climbing robots limited to onboard sensing. This work advances the aim of engineering complex systems that achieve specific human-designed goals.},

abstract = {In order to better understand the strategies of locomotion in small insects, we have studied continuous level locomotion of the wood ant species Formica polyctena. We determined the three-dimensional centre of mass kinematics during the gait cycle and recorded the ground reaction forces of single legs utilising a self-developed test site. Our findings show that the animals used the same gait dynamics across a wide speed range without dissolving the tripodal stride pattern. To achieve higher velocities, the ants proportionally increased stride length and stepping frequency. The centre of mass energetics indicated a bouncing gait, in which horizontal kinetic and gravitational potential energy fluctuated in close phase. We determined a high degree of compliance especially in the front legs, as the effective leg length was nearly halved during the contact phase. This leads to only small vertical oscillations of the body, which are important in maintaining ground contact. Bouncing gaits without aerial phases seem to be a common strategy in small runners and can be sufficiently described by the bipedal spring-loaded inverted pendulum model. Thus, with our results, we provide evidence that wood ants perform 'grounded running'.},

Collective Neuro-Evolution (CONE) co-evolves multiple robot controllers using emergent behavioral specialization in order to increase collective behavior task performance. CONE is comparatively evaluated with two related controller design methods in a collective construction task. The task requires robots to gather building blocks and assemble the blocks in specific sequences in order to build structures.

To form useful shapes such as tools, the chain should be folded to meet the functional requirements of the task such as mechanical strength.

By adopting a modular approach, robots with different capabilities, shapes, and sizes could, in theory, construct and reconfigure themselves as required.

Here, we present robots whose bodies and control systems can merge to form entirely new robots that retain full sensorimotor control. Our control paradigm enables robots to exhibit properties that go beyond those of any existing machine or of any biological organism: the robots we present can merge to form larger bodies with a single centralized controller, split into separate bodies with independent controllers, and self-heal by removing or replacing malfunctioning body parts. This work takes us closer to robots that can autonomously change their size, form and function.},

abstract = {The fields of modular reconfigurable robotics and programmable matter study how to compose functionally useful systems from configurations of modules. In addition to the external shape of a module configuration, the internal arrangement of modules and bonds between them can greatly impact functionally relevant mechanical properties such as load bearing ability. A fast method to evaluate the mechanical property aids the search for an arrangement of modules achieving a desired mechanical property as the space of possible configurations grows combinatorially. We present a fast approximate method where the bonds between modules are represented with stiffness matrices that are general enough to represent a wide variety of systems and follows the natural modular decomposition of the system. The method includes nonlinear modeling such as anisotropic bonds and properties that vary as components flex. We show that the arrangement of two types of bonds within a programmable matter systems enables programming the apparent elasticity of the structure. We also present a method to experimentally determine the stiffness matrix for chain style reconfigurable robots. The efficacy of applying the method is demonstrated on the CKBot modular robot and two programmable matter systems: the Rubik's snake folding chain toy and a right angle tetrahedron chain called RATChET7mm. By allowing the design space to be rapidly explored we open the door to optimizing modular structures for desired mechanical properties such as enhanced load bearing and robustness.},

We present a deep RL method that is practical for real-world robotics tasks, such as robotic manipulation, and generalizes effectively to never-before-seen tasks and objects. In these settings, ground truth reward signals are typically unavailable, and we therefore propose a self-supervised model-based approach, where a predictive model learns to directly predict the future from raw sensory readings, such as camera images. At test time, we explore three distinct goal specification methods: designated pixels, where a user specifies desired object manipulation tasks by selecting particular pixels in an image and corresponding goal positions, goal images, where the desired goal state is specified with an image, and image classifiers, which define spaces of goal states. Our deep predictive models are trained using data collected autonomously and continuously by a robot interacting with hundreds of objects, without human supervision. We demonstrate that visual MPC can generalize to never-before-seen objects---both rigid and deformable---and solve a range of user-defined object manipulation tasks using the same model.},

abstract = {— Joint symbolic and geometric planning is one of the core challenges in robotics. We address the problem of multi-agent cooperative manipulation, where we aim for jointly optimal paths for all agents and over the full manipulation sequence. This joint optimization problem can be framed as a logic-geometric program. Existing solvers lack several features (such as consistently handling kinematic switches) and efficiency to handle the cooperative manipulation domain. We propose a new approximate solver scheme, combining ideas from branch-and-bound and MCTS and exploiting multiple levels of bounds to better direct the search. We demonstrate the method in a scenario where a Baxter robot needs to help a human to reach for objects.},

abstract = {— As we progress towards a world where robots play an integral role in society, a critical problem that remains to be solved is the Pickup Team Challenge; that is, dynamically formed heterogeneous robot teams executing coordinated tasks where little information is known a priori about the tasks, the robots, and the environments in which they will operate. Successful solutions to forming pickup teams will enable researchers to experiment with larger numbers of robots and enable industry to efficiently and cost-effectively integrate new robot technology with existing legacy teams. In this paper, we define the challenge of pickup teams and propose the treasure hunt domain for evaluating the performance of pickup teams. Additionally, we describe a basic implementation of a pickup team that can search and discover treasure in a previously unknown environment. We build on prior approaches in market-based task allocation and plays for synchronized task execution, to allocate roles amongst robots in the pickup team, and to execute synchronized team actions to accomplish the treasure hunt task.},

abstract = {Robust control maintains stability and performance for a fixed amount of model uncertainty but can be conservative since the model is not updated online. Learning-based control, on the other hand, uses data to improve the model over time but is not typically guaranteed to be robust throughout the process. This paper proposes a novel combination of both ideas: a robust Min-Max Learning-Based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MM-LB-NMPC) algorithm. Based on an existing LB-NMPC algorithm, we present an efficient and robust extension, altering the NMPC performance objective to optimize for the worst-case scenario. The algorithm uses a simple a priori vehicle model and a learned disturbance model. Disturbances are modelled as a Gaussian Process (GP) based on experience collected during previous trials as a function of system state, input, and other relevant variables. Nominal state sequences are predicted using an Unscented Transform and worst-case scenarios are defined as sequences bounding the 3{\&}{\#}x03C3; confidence region. Localization for the controller is provided by an on-board, vision-based mapping and navigation system enabling operation in large-scale, GPS-denied environments. The paper presents experimental results from testing on a 50 kg skid-steered robot executing a path-tracking task. The results show reductions in maximum lateral and heading path-tracking errors by up to 30{\%} and a clear transition from robust control when the model uncertainty is high to optimal control when model uncertainty is reduced.},

abstract = {Many in the computer vision community have written papers on solving the " problem " of jigsaw puzzles for decades. Many of the former papers written cite the po-tential extension of this work to other more serious endeav-ors like reconstructing archaeological artifacts or fitting to-gether scanned objects while others simply do it because it's an interesting application of computer vision concepts. This author falls in the latter camp. Several methods for constructing jigsaw puzzles from images of the pieces were considered from a theoretical standpoint before the comput-ing power and the high-resolution image capturing devices necessary to employ these methods could be fully realized. More recently, many algorithms and methods tend toward disregarding piece shape as a discriminant entirely by us-ing " square pieces " and rely instead on the underlying im-age properties to find a solution. The jigsaw puzzle solver described in this paper falls somewhere in between these two extremes. The author of this project paper describes the creation of an " automatic " jigsaw puzzle solving pro-gram that relies on multiple concepts from computer vision as well as past work in the area to assemble puzzles from a single image of the disassembled pieces. While the pro-gram is currently specifically tailored to solve rectangular puzzles with " canonical " puzzle pieces, concepts learned from this work can be used in concert with other computer vision advances to enhance the puzzle solver and make it more robust to varying piece and puzzle shape. The puzzle solver created for this purpose is fairly unique in that it uses a picture of the disassembled pieces as input, no reference to the original puzzle image, and is done using the Mat-lab Image Processing Toolbox. The solver created for this project was successfully used on five separate puzzles with different rectangular bounds and dissimilar puzzle images. These results are similar to others who have created simi-lar puzzle solvers in the past. Ultimately, the author hopes that this work could lay the groundwork for a smart phone application.},

In neuroevolution, i.e. evolving artificial neural networks (ANNs), one way that agents controlled by ANNs can evolve the ability to adapt is by encoding local learning rules. However, a significant problem with most such approaches is that local learning rules for every connection in the network must be discovered separately. This paper aims to show that learning rules can be effectively indirectly encoded by extending the Hypercube-based NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (Hy- perNEAT) method. Adaptive HyperNEAT is introduced to allow not only patterns of weights across the connectivity of an ANN to be gener- ated by a function of its geometry, but also patterns of arbitrary learning rules. Several such adaptive models with different levels of generality are explored and compared. The long-term promise of the new approach is to evolve large-scale adaptive ANNs, which is a major goal for neuroevo- lution.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the design and analysis of underactu-ated robotic hands that use tendons and compliant joints to en-able passive mechanical adaptation during grasping tasks. We use a quasistatic equilibrium formulation to predict the stability of a given grasp. This method is then used as the inner loop of an optimization algorithm that can find a set of actuation mecha-nism parameters that optimize the stability measure for an entire set of grasps. We discuss two possible approaches to design opti-mization using this framework, one using exhaustive search over the parameter space, and the other using a simplified gripper construction to cast the problem to a form that is directly solv-able using well-established optimization methods. Computations are performed in 3D, allow arbitrary geometry of the grasped objects and take into account frictional constraints. INTRODUCTION In this study 1 , we present a framework for the analysis and optimization of a class of passively adaptive underactuated robotic hands. In a broad sense, this is the task of replacing elaborate run-time algorithms (often requiring extensive sensor arrays for input and complex actuation mechanisms for execu-tion) with off-line analysis, performed before the hand is even built. We focus on highly underactuated hand models, where the number of joints far exceeds the number of actuators, noting for example that recent studies have shown reliable grasping perfor-mance with even a single actuator for multiple fingers and up to Individual parts of this work have been published in conference proceedings in [1, 2].

There are more physiological constraints than independent parameters. As constraints limit the parameter space where hopping is possible, they must be tuned to each other in order to allow for hopping at all. Within the range of physiologically possible hopping frequencies, a human hopper selects a frequency where the largest amount of energy can be delivered and still be stored elastically. During running and hopping animals use flat angles of the landing velocity resulting in maximum contact length. In this situation ground reaction force is proportional to specific contact time and total displacement is proportional to the square of the step duration. Contact time and hopping frequency are not simply determined by the natural frequency of the spring-mass system, but are influenced largely by the vector of the landing velocity. Differences in the aerial phase or in the angle of the landing velocity result in the different kinematic and dynamic patterns observed during running and hopping. Despite these differences, the model predicts the mass specific energy fluctuations of the center of mass per distance to be similar for runners and hoppers and similar to empirical data obtained for animals of various size. ?? 1989.},

Our picking technique can also be applied to placing objects. Implementation and experimentation on a custom-made direct-drive manipulator and a conventional manipulator are presented.

Polymers are the most common materials to be 3-D printed today, but there is great demand for a way to easily print metals. Existing techniques for 3-D printing metals tend to be expensive and energy-intensive, and usually require high temperatures or pressures, making them incompatible with polymers, organics, soft materials, and biological materials. Here, we describe room temperature liquid metals as complements to polymers for 3-D printing applications. These metals enable the fabrication of soft, flexible, and stretchable devices. We survey potential room temperature liquid metal candidates and describe the benefits of gallium and its alloys for these purposes. We demonstrate the direct printing of a liquid gallium alloy in both 2-D and 3-D and highlight the structures and shapes that can be fabricated using these processes. {\textcopyright} 2014 SPIE.},

Additive manufacturing has a wide range of applications and addresses many challenges inherited from conventional molding techniques such as human error, multistep fabrication, and manual handling. However, 3D printing soft functional robots with two-part platinum cure silicones requires development to match the material performance of the molded counterparts. In this paper, we present a custom 3D printer and an extrusion mechanism capable of 3D printing soft functional robots. Moreover, we compare the performance differences between our 3D printed soft robots and molded counterparts via lamination casting and lost wax casting. We validate our results by conducting multiple experiments such as blocked force, bend angle, failure pressure, and dimensional quality analyses. We demonstrate that our method enables 3D printing of soft robots that can perform better, or match the performance of molded counterparts while being more reliable and robust with the usage of the same materials.},

abstract = {Self-reconfigurable robots are built from modules which are autonomously able to change the way they are connected, thus changing the overall shape of the robot. This process is difficult to control because it involves the distributed coordination of large numbers of identical modules connected in time-varying ways. We present an approach to self-reconfiguration where the desired configuration is grown from an initial seed module. Seeds produce growth by creating a recruitment gradient, using local communication, which spare modules climb to locate the seed. The growth is guided by a novel representation of the desired configuration, which is automatically generated from a 3D CAD model. This approach has two salient features: (1) the representation is concise, with a size proportional to the global shape rather than the number of modules and (2) there is a clean separation between the goal and the local, goal independent rules used by the modules. We demonstrate three implementations of the local rules for recruitment, and show how one can trade-off the number of moves and messages, against time taken to reconfigure. $\backslash$n},

The algorithms presented here are inspired by cellular automata, using geometric rules to control module actions. The actuation model used is a general one, assuming only that modules can generally move over the surface of a group of modules. These algorithms can then be instantiated onto a variety of particular systems. Correctness proofs of many of the rule sets are also given for the generic geometry; this analysis can carry over to the instantiated algorithms to provide different systems with correct locomotion algorithms. We also present techniques for automated analysis that can be used for algorithms that are too complex to be easily analyzed by hand. 10.1177/0278364904044409},

In multi-robot systems, robots operating in parallel can potentially learn at a much faster rate by sharing information amongst themselves. In this work, we use an adapted version of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm in order to accomplish distributed online robotic learning in groups of robots with access to only local information. The effectiveness of the learning technique on a benchmark task (generating high-performance obstacle avoidance behavior) is evaluated for robot groups of various sizes, with the maximum group size allowing each robot to individually contain and manage a single PSO particle. To increase the realism of the technique, different PSO neighborhoods based on limitations of real robotic communication are tested and compared in this scenario. We explore the effect of varying communication power for one of these communication-based PSO neighborhoods. To validate the effectiveness of these learning techniques, fully distributed online learning experiments are run using a group of 10 real robots, generating results which support the findings from our simulations.},

abstract = {T he field of modular self-reconfigurable robotic systems addresses the design, fabrication , motion planning, and control of autonomous kinematic machines with variable morphology. Beyond conventional actuation, sensing, and control typically found in fixed-morphology robots, self-reconfigurable robots are also able to deliberately change their own shape by rearranging the connectivity of their parts in order to adapt to new circumstances, perform new tasks, or recover from damage. Over the last two decades, the field of modular robotics has advanced from proof-of-concept systems to elaborate physical implementations and simulations. Modular robots are usually composed of multiple building blocks of a relatively small repertoire, with uniform docking interfaces that allow transfer of mechanical forces and moments, electrical power, and communication throughout the robot. The modular building blocks often consist of some primary structural actuated unit and potentially some additional specialized units such as grippers, feet, wheels, cameras, payload, and energy storage and generation units. Figure 1 illustrates such a system in the context of a potential application. Modular self-reconfigurable robotic systems can be generally classified into several architectural groups by the geometric arrangement of their units. Several systems exhibit hybrid properties. ◆ Lattice Architectures: Lattice architectures have units that are arranged and connected in some regular, three-dimensional pattern, such as a simple cubic or hexagonal grid. Control and motion can be executed in parallel. Lattice architectures usually offer simpler reconfiguration, as modules move to a discrete set of neighboring locations in which motions can be made open-loop. The computational representation can also be more easily scaled to more complex systems.},

abstract = {As robots move beyond manufacturing applications to less predictable en-vironments, they can increasingly benefit, as animals do, from integrating sensing and control with the passive properties provided by particular com-binations and arrangements of materials and mechanisms. This realization is partly responsible for the recent proliferation of soft and bioinspired robots. Tuned materials and mechanisms can provide several kinds of benefits, in-cluding energy storage and recovery, increased physical robustness, and de-creased response time to sudden events. In addition, they may offer passive open-loop behaviors and responses to external changes in loading or envi-ronmental conditions. Collectively, these properties can also increase the stability of a robot as it interacts with the environment and allow the closed-loop controller to reduce the apparent degrees of freedom subject to control. The design of appropriate materials and mechanisms remains a challenging problem; bioinspiration, genetic algorithms, and numerical shape and mater-ials optimization are all applicable. New multimaterial fabrication processes are also steadily increasing the range and magnitude of passive properties available for intrinsically responsive robots.},

abstract = {Swarm intelligence principles have been widely studied and applied to a number of different tasks where a group of autonomous robots is used to solve a problem with a distributed approach, i.e. without central coordination. A survey of such tasks is presented, illustrating various algorithms that have been used to tackle the challenges imposed by each task. Aggregation, flocking, foraging, object clustering and sorting, navigation, path formation, deployment, collaborative manipulation and task allocation problems are described in detail, and a high-level overview is provided for other swarm robotics tasks. For each of the main tasks, (1) swarm design methods are identified, (2) past works are divided in task-specific categories, and (3) mathematical models and performance metrics are described. Consistently with the swarm intelligence paradigm, the main focus is on studies characterized by distributed control, simplicity of individual robots and locality of sensing and communication. Distributed algorithms are shown to bring cooperation between agents, obtained in various forms and often without explicitly programming a cooperative behavior in the single robot controllers. Offline and online learning approaches are described, and some examples of past works utilizing these approaches are reviewed.},

However, key challenges in the design and manufacture of soft robots include the complex fabrication processes and the interfacing of soft and rigid components.We used multimaterial three-dimensional (3D) printing to manufacture a combustion-powered robot whose body transitions from a rigid core to a soft exterior. This stiffness gradient, spanning three orders of magnitude in modulus, enables reliable interfacing between rigid driving components (controller, battery, etc.) and the primarily soft body, and also enhances performance.

abstract = {Purpose - Passively compliant underactuated mechanisms are one way to obtain the gripper which could accommodate to any irregular and sensitive grasping object. The purpose of the underactuation is to use less active inputs than the number of degrees of freedom of the gripper mechanism to drive the open and close motion of the gripper. Another purpose of underaction is to reduce the number of control variables. Design/methodology/approach - The underactuation can morph shapes of the gripper to accommodate different objects. As a result, the underactuated grippers require less complex control algorithms. The fully compliant mechanism has multiple degrees of freedom and can be considered as an underactuated mechanism. Findings - This paper presents a new design of the adaptive underactuated compliant gripper with distributed compliance. The optimal topology of the gripper structure was obtained by optimality criteria method using mathematical programming technique. Afterwards, the obtained model was improved by iterative finite element optimization procedure. The gripper was constructed entirely of silicon rubber. Originality/value - The main points of this paper are the explanation of the development and production of the new compliant gripper structure. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

This paper proposes a new hierarchical planning framework to solve the assembly planning problem for architectural discrete structures, which usually have a long planning horizon and 3D configuration complexity. By decoupling sequence and motion planning, the planning framework is able to efficiently solve the assembly sequence, end-effector poses, joint configurations, and transition trajectories for assembly of spatial structures with nonstandard topologies, which hasn't been demonstrated in previous literature. Together with the algorithmic results, this paper also presents an open-source and modularized software implementation called Choreo that is machine and application-agnostic. To demonstrate the power of this algorithmic framework, three case studies, including real fabrication and simulation results, are presented to show Choreo's application on spatial extrusion.},

It reviews the general formulation, terminology, and typical experimental implementations of reinforcement learning as well as competing solution paradigms. In order to compare the relative merits of various techniques, it presents a case study of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with unknown dynamics, perhaps the simplest and best-studied problem in optimal control. It also describes how merging techniques from learning theory and control can provide nonasymptotic characterizations of LQR performance and shows that these characterizations tend to match experimental behavior. In turn, when revisiting more complex applications, many of the observed phenomena in LQR persist. In particular, theory and experiment demonstrate the role and importance of models and the cost of generality in reinforcement learning algorithms. The article concludes with a discussion of some of the challenges in designing learning systems that safely and reliably interact with complex and uncertain environments and how tools from reinforcement learning and control might be combined to approach these challenges.},

We formulate the search for such configurations as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). Collision constraints in an operation and transfer constraints between operations determine the sets of feasible robot configurations. We show that solving the connected constraint graph with off-the-shelf CSP algorithms can quickly become infeasible even for a few sequential assembly operations. We present an algorithm which, through the assumption of feasible regrasps, divides the CSP into independent smaller problems that can be solved exponentially faster. The algorithm then uses local search techniques to improve this solution by removing a gradually increasing number of regrasps from the plan. The algorithm enables the user to stop the planner anytime and use the current best plan if the cost of removing regrasps from the plan exceeds the cost of executing those regrasps. We present simulation experiments to compare our algorithm's performance to a naive algorithm which directly solves the connected constraint graph. We also present a real robot system which uses the output of our planner to grasp and bring parts together in assembly configurations.},

abstract = {Coordinated control strategies for multi-robot systems are necessary for tasks that cannot be executed by a single robot. This encompasses tasks where the workspace of the robot is too small or where the load is too heavy for one robot to handle. Using multiple robots makes the task feasible by extending the workspace and/or increase the payload of the overall robotic system. In this paper, we consider two instances of such tasks: a co-worker scenario in which a human hands over a large object to a robot; intercepting a large flying object. The problem is made difficult as the pick-up/intercept motions must take place while the object is in motion and because the object's motion is not deterministic. The challenge is then to adapt the motion of the robotic arms in coordination with one another and with the object. Determining the pick-up/intercept point is done by taking into account the workspace of the multi-arm system. The point is continuously recomputed to adapt to change in the object's trajectory. We propose a virtual object based dynamical systems (DS) control law to generate autonomous and synchronized motions for a multi-arm robot system. We show theoretically that the multi-arm + virtual object system converges asymptotically to the moving object. We validate our approach on a dual-arm robotic system and demonstrate that it can resynchronize and adapt the motion of each arm in a fraction of a second, even when the motion of the object is fast and not accurately predictable.},

abstract = {In this paper, reinforcement learning is applied to coordinate, in a decentralized fashion, the motions of a pair of hydraulic actuators whose task is to firmly hold and move an object along a specified trajectory under conventional position control. The learning goal is to reduce the interaction forces acting on the object that arise due to inevitable positioning errors resulting from the imperfect closed-loop actuator dynamics. Each actuator is therefore outfitted with a reinforcement learning neural network that modifies a centrally planned formation constrained position trajectory in response to the locally measured interaction force. It is shown that the actuators, which form a multiagent learning system, can learn decentralized control strategies that reduce the object interaction forces and thus greatly improve their coordination on the manipulation task. However, the problem of credit assignment, a common difficulty in multiagent learning systems, prevents the actuators from learning control strategies where each actuator contributes equally to reducing the interaction force. This problem is resolved in this paper via the periodic communication of limited local state information between the reinforcement learning actuators. Using both simulations and experiments, this paper examines some of the issues pertaining to learning in dynamic multiagent environments and establishes reinforcement learning as a potential technique for coordinating several nonlinear hydraulic manipulators performing a common task.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of robust controller design for holonomic constrained robotic systems which guarantees global asymptotic and exponential like stability of joints' position and velocity tracking error. It is well known that the presence of the constraints makes the controller design more complex as compared to the unconstrained robots such as serial manipulators. Control algorithms should be developed to satisfy both the system dynamics as well as kinematic constraints without explicit computation of the inverse kinematics. The paper develops a new robust control algorithm which can be applied in trajectory tracking control for both parallel and constrained serial manipulators. The method considers the constraint forces in the system dynamics to improve the system stability and tracking performance. The controller is designed through the direct Lyapunov approach and ensures asymptotic and exponential like stability in the position and velocity tracking errors. In order to verify the validity of the proposed control algorithm the algorithm is applied on two different illustrative examples. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Machine learning is one of the fastest growing areas of computer science, with far-reaching applications. The aim of this textbook is to introduce machine learning, and the algorithmic paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides an extensive theoretical account of the fundamental ideas underlying machine learning and the mathematical derivations that transform these principles into practical algorithms. Following a presentation of the basics of the field, the book covers a wide array of central topics that have not been addressed by previous textbooks. These include a discussion of the computational complexity of learning and the concepts of convexity and stability; important algorithmic paradigms including stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and structured output learning; and emerging theoretical concepts such as the PAC-Bayes approach and compression-based bounds. Designed for an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate course, the text makes the fundamentals and algorithms of machine learning accessible to students and non-expert readers in statistics, computer science, mathematics, and engineering.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of model-based versus model-free methods is a long-standing question in reinforcement learning (RL). Motivated by recent empirical success of RL on continuous control tasks, we study the sample complexity of popular model-based and model-free algorithms on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). We show that for policy evaluation, a simple model-based plugin method requires asymptotically less samples than the classical least-squares temporal difference (LSTD) estimator to reach the same quality of solution; the sample complexity gap between the two methods can be at least a factor of state dimension. For policy evaluation, we study a simple family of problem instances and show that nominal (certainty equivalence principle) control also requires several factors of state and input dimension fewer samples than the policy gradient method to reach the same level of control performance on these instances. Furthermore, the gap persists even when employing commonly used baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result which demonstrates a separation in the sample complexity between model-based and model-free methods on a continuous control task.},

abstract = {We propose a new paradigm for construction in which teams of quadrotor helicopters assemble 2.5-D structures from simple structural nodes and members equipped with magnets. The structures, called Special Cubic Structures (SCS), are a class of 2.5-D truss-like structures free of overhangs and holes. Quadrotors equipped with grippers pick up, transport, and assemble the structural elements. The design of the nodes and members imposes constraints on assembly, which are incorporated into the design of the algorithms used for assembly. We show that any SCS can be built using only the feasible assembly modes for individual structural elements and present simulation and experimental results for a team of quadrotors performing automated assembly. The paper includes a theoretical analysis of the SCS construction algorithm, the rationale for the design of the structural nodes, members and quadrotor gripper, a description of the quadrotor control methods for part pickup, transport and assembly, and an empirical analysis of system performance.},

abstract = {The TERMES system is a robot collective capable of autonomous construction of 3D user-specified structures. A key component of the framework is an off-line compiler which takes in a structure blueprint and generates a directed map, in turn permitting an arbitrary number of robots to perform decentralized construction in a provably correct manner. In past work, this compiler was limited to a non-optimized search approach which scaled poorly with the structure size. Here, we recast the process as a constraint satisfaction problem and present new scalable compiler schemes and the ability to quickly generate provably correct maps (or find that none exist) of structures with up to 1 million bricks. We compare the performance of the compilers on a range of structures, and show how the structure completion time is related to the inter-dependencies between built locations. We then show how the transition probability between locations in the structure affect assembly time, and may be optimized to drastically improve system efficiency. This work represents an important step towards collective robotic construction of real-world structures.},

@article{Stoy2014,
abstract = { Self-reconfigurable robots are built from modules, which are autonomously able to change the way they are connected, thus changing the overall shape of the robot. This self-reconfiguration process is difficult to control, because it involves the distributed coordination of large numbers of identical modules connected in time-varying ways. We present an approach where a desired shape is grown based on a scalable representation of the desired configuration, which is automatically generated from a 3D CAD model. The size of the configuration is adjusted continually to match the number of modules in the system. This has the advantage that if modules are removed or added, the system automatically adjusts its scale and thus self-repair is obtained as a side effect. This capability is achieved by distributed, local rules for module movement that are independent of the goal configuration. We compare the scale independent approach to one where the desired configuration is grown directly at a fixed scale. We find that the features of the scale independent approach come at the expense of an increased number of moves, messages, and time steps taken to reconfigure.},

Unlike previous approaches that use a forced-exploration scheme, we construct a high-probability confidence set around the model parameters and design an algorithm that plays optimistically with respect to this confidence set. The construction of the confidence set is based on the recent results from online least-squares estimation and leads to improved worst-case regret bound for the proposed algorithm.
